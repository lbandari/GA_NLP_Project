boardgames,I was reading the comments on a Brothers Murph video Someone posted there are mechanics I love and some I haaaaaate That got me wondering if I hated any mechanics There are some I like more than others but I couldn t think of any I hate The only one I had a problem with multiple times was trading resources There have been times when a couple would make really unfair trades with each other It was obvious the female was trading to make her husband happy Fortunately I am good enough friends with them to point this out I even found a short podcast on this subject and played it for them The term they used was lioning But I believe this was instances of people abusing not playing as intended not the mechanic I have a friends wife that refuses to play auction games I just don t get it Why I m guessing it s because she s not good at it Are there mechanics you hate and why What mechanics do you hate and why,179,733,911

boardgames,So I recently got the Dominion Alchemy expansion purchased sight unseen from a friend who was liquidating When I finally received it and started looking through it the following cards were missing 10 each of the familiar herbalist philosophers stone and university cards and the 16 potion and 12 randomizer cards I imagine they accidentally got packed up with her copy of the base game and were sold off in an earlier sale My friend apologized and refunded but are the rest of the cards worth keeping and incorporating into the base game I haven t pulled down the rule book and read through it yet so didn t know if the others alchemist apothecary apprentice golem possession scrying pool transmute and vineyard can be incorporated without the missing potion cards It definitely looks like some can but don t know about balance issues or anything like that And I have no interest in trying to piecemeal this thing back together if that s even possible Dominion Alchemy missing cards,170,813,982

boardgames,To start I absolutely love Bullet heart and think it s brilliant in design art direction and execution I highly recommend it to anyone who seems remotely interested I ve already played it a bunch and even bought a copy for a friend So when it was announced there would be a character pack already releasing soon I was quite excited Then I saw the characters in Bullet orange fortable about the character s art design or at worst put off from the whole franchise as a whole I have almost no problem with the representation in the base game and in fact champion the game for doing its part in helping to balance gender representation in board games In general I think L99 games do a decent job at tasteful representation though there are some abhorrent exceptions to this rule practically the whole Season 1 of Exceed While I have no problem with an expansion featuring only younger heroines like many in the base game I can t say the same thing when the two youngest characters Shugiri and QP 14 year old girls are both drawn with comically short skirts that cut off just below their waists skin showing on their upper thighs It feels gratuitous this detail drawn in a way that appeals to the male gaze which is especially inappropriate given they re underage I then did a quick google search of the game s artist UsanekoRin and the fact that he s drawing stuff that appears to be sexualize an underage girl which I won t link to here makes me feel gross When I brought this up on the discord most people responded that for anime it s pretty tame which misses the point I m not trying to argue that it is explicit for an anime but that viewed in a vacuum it is a strange choice to have two 14 year old girls drawn by a man in a game made by all men wearing skirts that could literally not be any shorter without showing underwear To me L99 are shooting themselves in the foot and limiting the broad appeal of this game which is otherwise HUGE the design is easy to learn fun to play vibrant and exciting I think they have a case of tunnel vision when trying to appeal to their core fan base which is probably a bunch of anime fans that don t mind this sort of thing when they could appeal to practically the whole board gaming community because the design is so strong in every other aspect I attempted to have this discussion in the L99 discord but was shut down by Brad their president for encouraging ethical or political discussions and was told to bring it to BGG or Reddit So here we are Let s talk about the art in Bullet Orange,479,2056,2534
boardgames,I just bought concordia venus base game expansion for 54 CAD from a store in my city Every other store sells the same game for 85 99 depending where you look Everything else that this store stocks is also about 30 cheaper than everywhere else As far as I can tell they arent selling counterfeits so I m confused as to how they can possibly be profiting off of their games They are primarily a TCG store but i don t know if that somehow explains it and other TCG stores that also sell board games do not sell at such a discount I know that game stores get a discount off of the end user price Is the discount large enough to allow this sort of a price drop usually Thanks Discounts for board game store owners,138,571,708

boardgames,This post isn t in meant in any way to insult Lovecraft works or those who enjoy it It s just an observation after only playing board games for a year or so As someone who s always been pretty deep into movies tv shows video games books and general pop culture lovecraft works have always been present but fairly niche You d see a video game or movie with Cthulhu like monster designs but that was about it In recent years there s been a significant uptick in all forms of media like call of cthulhu Lovecraft country color of outer space and more It s definitely gotten bigger but I d say it s still relatively niche in mainstream pop culture This isn t the case at all in board games You see people talking everyday about Arkham Horror LCG Arkham Horror board game Eldritch Horror Cthulhu Death May Die Mansions of Madness and more This doesn t even include the non Cthulhu games where he makes an appearance I read every other day of people who are entering the hobby and asking for Lovecraft games because they love the theme so much Again this isn t a knock against the people who enjoy them but i just find it unusual that i rarely see people asking for book movie tv show or video games about Lovecraft Is there something about board games that particularly shines in adapting these works Has it always been this way or is it just a recent trend Why are board games obsessed with lovecraft Is it a recent trend,267,1151,1417

boardgames,Hey folks maybe this is an r relationship post but I figure this community might have some good answers on this I have a friend who is a real bummer when the game stops going his way Not always but often enough to be a problem It tends to go one of two ways Either he starts complaining about the game how it s unfair the choices aren t good and had no way of winning its the games fault I m losing vibe or worse its a string of harassing annoying questions by forcing some linguistic ambiguity of a rule Not sure how to explain that one but as an example in Descent JITD 2e he challenged my use of a card because it said Move a monster of your choice twice or something and he started asking Does the boss character count as a monster Does it say boss character on the card etc Same game he tried insisting he should be allowed to rest and move because rest was given on the mini card reminder of possible actions and you are allowed two actions When I told him it is included because it is an action but if you take that action it means you can t take any others He asked me five times Are you saying the card is wrong Now Descent being Descent thankfully there was a wealth of online FAQs and to my relief this was one of them yes obviously the boss character counts as a monster and there was a clear explanation of the Rest rule in the rulebook so we could move on but often times there isn t In those situations either the game grinds to a halt indefinitely or I say I don t agree but let s move on 50 50 chance of success or we roll a dice for it which is a bummer because I only stand to lose and abandon a rule of the game because it doesn t suit him in this moment in time I m not sure if he knows that the rules applies and he s doing this because he can get his way or because he genuinely thinks the rule doesn t apply in this case Anyway this generally been a minor annoyance to otherwise fun games nights It would be a case of when my wife asked How was the games Day I would say something like yeah it was smashing Anonbud got upset again for a while but it didn t last long But recently we played a game I really love and I left it bummed I did well and eventually won and because of that we had to spend most of the game talking about how unfair the game is how bad Anonbuds luck was how toxic the game is how bad the wait times are etc I love the post game break down and this time I just left It was a bad feeling I don t know why this was the tipping point but I just feel I ve had enough of it now I love Tabletop games but I I don t want to play them when I m quietly hoping for another player to win because if he wins we can all have a good time When Anonbud is winning we genuinely all have a great time We had an incredible game of Terra Mystica where he played brilliantly and it was one of the best gaming days we ve had in ages Everyone was engaged excited and eager to play again That happens too And he doesn t always get upset when he is losing So boardgame lovers what do I do Here are my options as I see them Suck it up We can all get a bit grumpy every now and then with a bad run of luck too Maybe he just gets grumpy more often and more vocally than most We still often have good fun So just keep playing fingers crossed under the table that he wins or that for some other reason he behaves like a grown up Talk to him about it I have tried this before We talked about how cool it is that Otherbud in games group is such a lovely fella that even if he finished the game with zero points he is always in such great spirits and how much fun it is when other players are positive and enthusiastic Anonbud even recognised yeah I m not good at that lol and so I thought he might catch that behaviour He didn t So if I talk to him about it now it has to be more direct But like Hey man could you not act like a giant fucking whiny baby when you lose because it is really bumming me out Is it possible to say that in anything remotely like a nice way Is there anyway someone could hear that message and take it as feedback I don t see any way of doing that which isn t cruel hurtful and humiliating and I don t want to do that to him He s a friend These are just games amp x200B Stop playing with that group This is the saddest one but honestly it s the one I m thinking of going with The other two guys are lovely but it would be a bit gross to cut him out in some way Talk to the other two about it Nah not really an option They are lovely fellas but me and Anonbud are closer to each other than to them It would feel weirdly treacherous and high schooly to go talking about him with them Not for me If they have a problem with it they can say it I ll even back them up But I m not going to rope them into what is really my concern If you read this far then thank you Just feeling a bit sad that my favourite hobby and social event is now something that I don t want to do I know I know the world is on fire and I

boardgames,My search for the light wargaming continues It started with Memoir 44 but the sheer amount of content set up and set down time and the limited decision space meant I had to move on Made a jump to Conflict of Heroes 3rd Edition It s a great looking game but needs a lot of investment in learning the rules in detail and the game play was a bit too slow and uneventful for my group Warfighter is brilliant and again it does require some investment in learning rules and edge scenarios but the gameplay is quite exciting and fun But it s a co op solo game Now getting Heroes of Stalingrad Arriving this week There s not a lot of quality play through videos for this or it s predecessor Heroes of Normandie but the reviews have all said that this is probably the only light war game which has the best rules to depth ratio There s not a lot on this sub on this game Stalingrad so I thought I ll put it out here so people can share their reviews and impressions on Heroes of Stalingrad Thanks Any love for Heroes of Stalingrad,198,824,1021

boardgames,Don t judge my stacking mVnpsOv jpg I started in October of 2018 with highly recommended games such as 7 Wonders Duel Carcassonne and Fox in the Forest I think my girlfriend bought Splendor for us as well but none of these games stuck Carcassonne sits at a 3 10 for me while Fox in the Forest is a 4 7WD and Splendor are both decent but I fell off and didn t play any games in 2019 In 2020 I decided to try Spirit Island my first holy grail I had been putting it off due to the difficulty but I had nothing to lose so I just went for it I still haven t played Spirit Island as much as I would like but I finally hit on some games in the months to follow 2020 Hits Spirit Island 7 Codenames Duet 7 most played to this date Hanamijoki 10 Arboretum 7 The Mind 7 Baseball Highlights 2045 9 Cockroach Poker 8 Space Hulk Death Angel 8 Decrypto 7 Dinogenics 7 Watergate 8 Like 5 Buttonshy games 7s Chinatown 8 The Bloody Inn 7 In this time I sorta hit on Dominion I loved this until I got further down my hits list I find I fall in love with a game and then a previous 10 gets downgraded and shifts my entire system of tiers down a notch lol This also happened with Robinson Crusoe and to a lesser extent Nemo s War Once I found less fiddly solo games to be mentioned later I traded these away but they were important stepping stones Kingdomino Lost Cities Agricola ACAB Biblios Bonanza The Duel and The Lost Expedition were all fine but I gifted them away as I tried to keep a higher standard for my enjoyment So I probably went through buying around 40 games in the second half of 2020 but 2021 is when I hit on the backbone of my favorites list now First I hit on Cosmic Encounter 10 which is by far my favorite game to play with others I then got a great deal on everything Aeon s End 9 and played through all the sets way too much I also hit on Pax Pamir 2e 7 Deception Murder in Hong Kong 8 Shadows in Kyoto 8 Dungeon Petz 8 Ra 8 Wavelength 8 After the Virus 8 Flamme Rouge 9 Obsession 9 But my two favorite solo have been Darkest Night 2e and Mage Knight Both 10s Although I don t have a victory between the two of them I don t have much I want to change because I waited until I found a good stopping point for now but my next buys will be some combo of Innovation Agricola Star Wars Rebellion and Targi Also waiting on a couple Buttonshy Kickstarters the new Aeon s End and Maquis I would like to thank the stimulus checks for the funds and not having to work for the time to play but funnily enough what stopped me for now is my desire to stop having to learn rulebooks I fear I m running out of room in my head and I d like to know all my games decently I already feel like I mentioned more games than I needed to so HERE collection user tripleblacktri own 1 amp subtype boardgame amp ff 1 is my profile if you re still interested Also I m curious what outside opinions of my collection are Like I think I know what I like at this point but I m curious what you guys see on my shelves and if you have further recommendations among those lines COMC For the first time in months I don t have a package on the way Lend me your opinion,633,2503,3135

boardgames,Earlier this week I pondered what such and such variation of Chess would look like Perhaps I ll make a separate post about that another day But to get started I felt like I had to first answer the question What makes a game chess This of course takes into account all Chatur based games like International Chess Shogi and Xiangqi and variations thereof Here s what I came up with 1 Turn based 2 One player versus one player Sure Chess variants exist to host more players and Chess puzzles are single player but I m aiming for a main variant of Chess 3 Must be a game of perfect information https en wikipedia org wiki Perfect_information 4 The game board must be a rectangle of square spaces The board should have no holes but can have territories that function differently e g promotion zones in Intl Chess amp Shogi the castle and river in Xiangqi etc 5 Both players objective is to checkmate the opposing King 6 There are only game pieces no dice cards etc 7 All pieces begin life on the board However per Shogi there may be a hand for pieces during the mid game 8 The starting layout of one player s pieces is a reflection or rotation of the other player s starting layout Have to say rotation as well because of Chaturanga and Shogi With a good set of rules this means anything else can be changed but this especially includes The pieces their ability to move and their ability to capture The length and width of the board and any special territories thereof The starting layout of the pieces I m posting this to r boardgames first because I suspect you all have played enough non Chess board games to know if there s anything I ve missed or if these rules also describe something decidedly not Chess Thoughts Have any of you ever played a game that wasn t necessarily based on Chess but follows these rules What makes a game Chess like,343,1499,1841
boardgames,Hi everyone After watching a lot of reviews I decided to grab Bargain Quest and the two expansions for it I ve only played it a couple of times and while aesthetically it is nice I feel like its missing some level of strategy difficultly I have enjoyed that it s fairly easy to learn but in the games I ve played the monsters seem to die very quickly no more then 1 2 turns and the heroes are rarely ever lost in combat which makes it feel like there is an element of the game that s missing This in turn can make it so that buying to many upgrades to your shop puts you at a major disadvantage when it comes to calculating victory points at the end of the game because you have so few turns to use the advantages that those upgrades give you I ve contemplated just giving the monsters more health as a house rule or adding an additional hero to the board to select from but I wanted to see what other people have done to try to improve the game Side notes I haven t played with the expansions yet but they seem to add some nice elements How to Improve Bargain Quest,211,856,1066
boardgames,Hi I got the game in german and maybe some things are translated poorly So I ve got questions about a few cars Filius Flitwick translated from german he says Once per turn If you discard a spell get 1 Flash and 1 Heart Draw a card Is the draw a card section part of the If condition or can I draw a card no matter if I discarted a spell before Just to be safe allies can t trigger in response to an action from an enemy since the manual says you can use them in your turn right Same for the golden snitch Draw 2 cards only if you got at least 2 allies or not Confundo translated from german Your opponent has to discard a random card If it s a curse or a spell you get 1 Money Draw a card If it is an ally you get 1 Flash and 1 Heart Same as above Option 1 Draw a card only if the discarted card is a curse or a spell Option 2 Draw a card anyway If option 2 is right Does the second it if it s an ally you get refer to the discarted card or to the card you just draw I don t know if it is better in english I like the game but some wordings are very poor imo Thanks in advance Hogwarts Battle defense against the dark arts rules question,243,895,1137

boardgames,How it started Like a lot of people I grew up playing games with my family We d play all the standards but Cranium was and is our go to during get togethers We get very competitive about it amp x200B Flashback to Christmas of last year I was at my girlfriend s family s celebration and they brought out Catan asking if I wanted to play I had never played before but of course had heard of it so I joined them and after the first game I was hooked I spend the next couple days researching Catan strategies and playing online We played one more time in person a couple days later before they left We also played some Codenames which I hadn t heard of previously amp x200B This got me thinking do I love Catan it certainly is fun with the right group or do I like the idea of playing board games in general It wasn t long until I stumbled across BGG and started consuming endless YouTube content best gateway games essential games for you collection etc The biggest shock to me and the naivete is hilarious now was that there were board games CONSTANTLY coming out I thought the popular ones at Target were about the extent of it amp x200B How it s going To cut out all of the middle parts that consist of mostly more YouTube and BGG research I started finding my taste in games Partially born out of the fact the people in my life aren t necessarily into learning heavier games but also because I enjoy the solitary experience I mostly play solo Jaws of the Lion was the first big game I dove into Hatchet and Voidwarden and since then some of my other faves are Aeon s End and even though I just got it to the table for the first time last night Cthulhu Death May Die was a lot of fun amp x200B I want to catch up on a small backlog I have before I commit time to Mage Knight and Too Many Bones since those are an undertaking I got a lot of games at a recent BGG meetup so I m making my way through those I m mostly caught up on games I want right now so my purchasing will slow to a crawl while I enjoy these amp x200B I am looking forward to some in person group meetups when it s safe to do so maybe I can finally try out Blood Rage lol Started playing this year and can t get enough,436,1750,2185

boardgames,A couple months ago I got Anachrony to the table for the first time at 2 player and was left feeling very unimpressed We didn t add in any of the modules and it just felt like a very stale worker placement game But despite having a poor first experience I ordered the Infinity box and decided to have another go at it We re no stranger to heavy games so I figured I d spent my day yesterday reading through all the modules and thought we d just go ahead and throw everything in It wasn t until I made it to module 4 of Future Imperfect where I noticed it said recommended to not be mixed with Doomsday and Pioneers of New Earth So I figured we d just skip this one and then I got started on Fractures of Time I ve read that this is the best thing released for Anachrony and once you play with it you ll always want to play with it I jumped to the compatibility section and also saw that it is not recommended with the same 2 modules from the Classic Expansion I was a little bummed out but since I already knew the rules to the previous ones I decided we d just go with that and I d learn the 2 skipped ones later We played with 3 players and wow What an incredible game We ended up playing with B side boards Doomsday Pioneers Guardians Neutronide Buildings Hypersync and Quantum Loop During our play the 3rd player mentioned that this might be one of their new favorites and ended up winning by 2 points Thanks to their Neutronide building Afterwards everyone agreed that this has to be played again and soon which got me thinking about module compatibility and what to do for next time I did some googling and only found a few threads going into the modules and the best way to mix them So that brings me to here How do you rank the modules and why How do you decide what to play with With Fractures of Time not being compatible with the earlier modules do you just simply not use those anymore Thanks in advanced for any responses Hoping to see some good discussion on the modules Anachrony,386,1609,1994

boardgames,Hey I m new to this reddit page I started getting into tabletop gaming back in 2016 when I discovered Elder Sign through a YouTube channel called Geek amp Sundry More specifically it was via a sub series on that channel called TableTop hosted by Wil Wheaton It really opened my eyes to this awesome hobby and world of board games that I never knew existed before I ve always been into video games and tabletop gaming was another thing I could nerd over but in different ways It s 2021 now and my collection keeps growing It s not as big as I want it to be yet my wishlist keeps growing but I ll get there eventually The downside is that I don t really have anyone to play with anymore Back when my hobby started I always had siblings around to play games with but a few of them moved away and now I only get to play games with a few friends whenever they aren t busy which is rare The last time I got to play anything was over a month ago This makes it really hard to finish playing through my most recent acquisition Dice Throne Adventures It s a game that requires you play through eight scenarios most of which last 2 3 hours each to finish it and I just don t have any friends who can visit that often to play it to get anywhere So I m hoping that changes soon My favorite games are definitely Dice Throne and Elder Sign though I also love Euros and engine builders like Abyss and Res Arcana I have another game that is being shipped to me in May called Twisted Fables that I backed on Kickstarter so I m excited for that Anyway this is just me introducing myself here and sharing my collection with you all I hope we can keep the discussion going Thanks My Collection,326,1347,1672

boardgames,My friends and I picked up Through the Ages years ago online but our playtime has really ramped up during quarantine For anyone who hasn t heard of it the game plexity means turns are often worth spending 15 minutes on optimizing I d love to hear if people have had similar experiences with this game or other games in that manner Most of my favorite in person games have quick turns alternations e g worker placements like Agricola and therefore aren t as satisfying asynchronously online Through the Ages is the perfect online board game for our group Alternate suggestions,101,475,575

boardgames,Hi I want to rebuy this beloved game from my childhood Genre Dungeon based game in which on every turn you move with a dice toss and depending on the step you land there s a down sided monster card on top of a treasure the way you beat the monsters I can t remember exactly might be the old you need more than X dice roll to kill it but what I do remember is that the objective was to collect most or as many as possible ring cards that also played as treasure cards hidden under monster cards As far as I remember there might be Dragon monster cards which were the strongest don t remember if they were always set on top of ring cards So as I said it was very ring based not to be confused with any LOTR specific game Multiplayer not PVP Need help identifying this boardgame from 2005 2008,157,634,790
boardgames,just got into a lively exchange about what is considered playing a monster card based on the mechanism in gift of the elements where you can add monster cards to players decks and the wording of several cards it would seem that if a monster card is in your hand it will be played when you put it down at your turn now playing a monster card is pointless unless of course an event card like xeron s trial is active for anyone familiar with ascension gift of the elements what is your thought on this i know the game is a bit older now is there official guidance on this ascenion xeron s trial what is considered monster played,120,506,625

boardgames,My best friend Jay and I have really gotten into escape room games at home during this pandemic We have gotten together twice and played two Hunt a Killer seasons and five Deadbolt Mystery Society Boxes We dont want to subscribe to anything so we ve been getting past seasons or one time boxes We also played an Exit the last time we got together and really liked it We have done 2 Exit games over zoom and found that it works really well for us when we can t get together We live several hours apart We are planning a get together in May and I ve been looking into other boxed set companies and the Unlock games Anyone with experience with escape room games at home either with murder mystery boxed sets like Hunt a Killer or Exit games have any other recommendations for things we could play together I m looking into Unlock The Conundrum Box Escape the Crate Sleuth Kings But am very open to any and all other suggestions We are quickly working through the Exit series over zoom as we want to play at least every other week We each buy our own box and since Exit is cheap it has been pretty affordable I m also wondering if Unlock will work as well via zoom Or what other games would work well via zoom The murder mystery boxes are more for when we actually get together since they re more expensive Escape room games boxes,252,1075,1326

boardgames,I had some free time this week so I stole a friend s copy of Takenoko and made her an organizer from 1 8 Baltic Birch plywood Here is the final version a UEwjQJz Heavily inspired by the BT organizer I started with the large tiles and the small parts organizers One problem we have is reaching across the table to grab more bamboo and knocking over the ones on the board so I wanted at least two separate reservoirs for those pieces Finally her main complaint since getting the Chibis expansion was cards spilling all over so a sliding lid card box solved that issue That card box sits on top of another empty box that really is just to fill up the space inside the original box Give it a quick sand to remove any laser flashback hit it with some gel stain glue it all up and it s ready to hit the table I made an organizer for Takenoko,163,673,835

boardgames,A few months ago I really started to get into chess I really liked the idea of a miniature battlefield with tons of tactics and openings while still keeping it simple So I decided that it would be fun to make one In its current state it is playable but I bet there is room for development Note Explaining this on text is hard The game is actually really simple but all the cordinate stuff may make it look confusing I call it Emerald Game or just Emerald It is a two player game played on a square 10 by 10 board which is roughly 900cm² When writing coordinates the x axis comes first Eg x y Players can either play as red or blue Red always starts first Each player has 7 actually 6 different pieces at their disposal The objective is to eliminate your opponent s chateau which is the most valuable piece in the sense that if they lose it they just lose the game You can do this by either crushing it or throwing it off the board Yes You can throw pieces in this The throwing mechanic is really simple but when you first hear it you might get confused So let me explain When a piece that gets on a square that is already occupied by another piece regardless of color the original piece that was on the square will get thrown differently depending on which piece threw it I will explain this better after I introduce the pieces Note I made the board out of a strong cardboard and made every piece by some play dough which I hardened The Pieces Note Pieces can be eliminated by getting thrown off the board or by getting crushed by a chateau Note A player can intentionally walk off their pieces off the board 1x Chateau When a game starts the red chateau is placed at 5 5 and the blue chateau is placed at 6 6 When a player s chateau is eliminated it is game over for them Can not move by itself The chateau can spawn any piece that hasn t been eliminated or spawned before in a 5x5 square that it is in the center of If thrown the first piece the chateau bumps into both stops the chateau and directly eliminates the piece it bumped into This is an ability that only the chateau has amp x200B 2x Gladiator Can only move north south east and west one square If it gets on a square that is already occupied it throws the piece occypying it either 2 squares to the left or 2 squares to the right Lets say there is a gladiator on 3 3 and it moves to 4 3 where a chateau was standing Now it throws to chateau to either 4 5 or 4 1 amp x200B 1x Bull It can see all the way to the north south east and west Can normally only move north south east and west one square If there is a piece in its vision it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it It can t stop midway The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target Lets say that a bull is standing on 1 1 and it wants to throw a gladiator on 5 1 there are 3 squares between 1 1 and 5 1 which are 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 So now the gladiator will get thrown to 8 1 So this means that it can t move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn t be any squares between them amp x200B 2x Ram Basically a diagonal bull It can see all the way to the northeast southeast northwest and southwest Can normally only move northeast southeast northeast and southwest one square If there is a piece in its vision it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it It can t stop midway The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target Lets say that a ram is standing on 1 1 and it wants to throw a gladiator on 5 5 there are 3 squares between 1 1 and 5 5 which are 2 2 3 3 and 4 4 So now the gladiator will get thrown to 8 8 So this means that it can t move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn t be any squares between them amp x200B 1x Wall Can t do anything Seriously Doesn t mean its useless tho It can block like rams or bulls or soften a throw I will tell you about that amp x200B 1x Wizard Can see all the way to north south east west northeast northwest southeast and southwest Can move only one square to north south east west northeast northwest southeast and southwest Can pull the first piece it has vision on right next to itself Lets say a wizard is on 2 2 there is a wall on 5 5 and a ram on 2 8 The wizard can pull the wall to 3 3 or pull the ram to 2 3 Pushes pieces only one square Can be placable for both players only after a chateau regardless of color gets thrown amp x200B 1x Giant it is currently not legal waiting for suggestions Can see and move to the north south west east northeast southeast northwest and southwest only one square Has unlimited throwing power it will make every piece go flying Yeah I made this piece but never used it It is currently banned because it is too overpowered The purpose of the giant was to keep the action maximum in every position It was originally only able to be spawned after a player s every single piece had been eliminated But I noticed that getting rid of every piece is VERY hard even when you do it intentionally The piece still exist with some scrapped ideas but I would like to see what other people think it may be good for amp x200B But wait Yeah pieces can throw each other but what happens if a piece bumps into another piece when it arrives at its destined square It just makes the other piece move 1 square the direction it bumped in But what if bumps in to another piece while it is still on the way to its destined square It makes the piece it bumped move 1 square and it becomes the new occupier of the square amp x200B Those principles apply to throwing amp x200B Thats it Thats Emerald Thank you for reading this all the way to here As I said there is definetly room for development and I would really REALLY like this to be at least played by other people Thanks again for reading this It really means a lot A Board Game I Made

boardgames,So I ve been doing YouTube how to play videos solo playthroughs and things of that nature I m about to get into doing reviews as well and I was curious for anyone reading this what question gets answered for you in a board game review Do you watch reviews for the entertainment aspect Maybe you re watching to learn if a particular game has any mechanics that you might like Or maybe you want to know if the reviewer your watching likes the game and would recommend it I m sure people watch reviews how to plays and other board game content for a myriad of reasons but I m curious what are you hoping to learn from a review Also I m curious as to what sort of format you like to see in reviews Do you like reviews that are super structured for example Today we are reviewing Everdell and in this review I m going to break it down for you by theme art quality player interaction gameplay etc etc Or do you prefer a more free flowing style where the reviewer literally just jumps from topic to topic in no real formal way talking to the camera as if trying to sell a friend on how good or bad a game is Also what do you feel about a letter or number score as opposed to I recommend or do not recommend this game And lastly do you like a more objective review or subjective Ie I could say objectively Lost Ruins of Arnak is a great game The mechanics at play really mesh well together m bla bla bla But subjectively I don t like it because of A B and C I actually love Arnak but just as an example Do you watch board game reviews and what question gets answered for you,310,1257,1566

boardgames,During the pandemic my beloved hobby of playing board games with friends at the table has been as I guess for many others in here pretty much dead I just re arranged all my board games in a new shelf and got this idea what if we could play board games over a conference call video live with everyone participating from home I have a lot of friends and colleagues that wants to play but I m the one with the games Meaning we need to play with only one copy of the game I m really curious if anyone have tried this in that case what game and how did it go If not then do you have any ideas on what games that could work and how this could be done I m thinking party games in general should be fine some deduction games and maybe puzzle mystery solving etc Hidden roles can be done by showing a card to each player while all others close their eyes camera Some coop games should work fine if all information is public I m thinking to set up a camera that films the table for everyone to see Also it could be possible to use regular dice and playing cards as component replacements as I expect everyone to have this at disposal One thing that will not work is holding a hidden deck cards etc for players Open decks could be placed in player areas on the table and be shown on camera so this should work fine Note Please dont recommend apps PC games etc as alternatives I know and use these but I want to try this concept with the real deal Out of my collection I m thinking these could maybe work Camel Up Castles of Burgundy Chronicles of Crime Codenames each clue giver takes a screenshot of the answer card Ghost Stories Hey That s my Fish Magic Maze this is probably too hard to coordinate Mysterium One Night Ultimate Werewolf maybe without some roles game master Pandemic Ricochet Robots Scotland Yard Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective Small World Telestrations When I Dream I would LOVE to hear your ideas Playing board games over video conference with only ONE copy of the game What to play,379,1619,1997

Community Edition A TRUE memetic philosopher s stone Premier fully functional meta balanced hyper compressible meta memeplex psycho cultural alchemic memetic technology that uses neurolinguistics hyper juxtaposition and other methods to circumvent synthetic epistemics while programming the players into a 4g 5g warfare psycho spiritual frame It exploits memetic virality and asymmetric psychological archetypal memetic feedback loops It takes the form of a trading card game but it is so so much more This is the full 501 card set and comes with a custom box artwork file pictured This is the first of its kind to offer meritocratic access to the zeitgeist It is a memetic snapshot of 2020 A TRUE memetic philosopher s stone CULTURE WINS WARS STR33T 4LCH3MY Illuminati New World Order set out to expose via card gamification the World Gamification The resistance towards and stickiness of the idea means these projects are over the target The other 4chan and INWO projects always seem to fail for whatever reason So I decided to take it upon myself so there would be no excuse not to complete it I designed this game as a psycho cultural spiritual memetic weapon seed ark The idea is to train people into an effective perspective while bringing their memeplex up to date all abstracted under lulz I offer this so that you might have content to freely offer someone else and engage with them The idea is to have the gateway be like forbidden lulz and then break the programming implicitly through hyper juxtaposition and archetypal drift It s content at minimum Print them if you want This is an open source community project I want it to run off crypto to combat revisionism and to pay the anons who contribute powerful memes automatically This is a method to construct culture meritocratically and transparently on any scale Think of the cards as culture units and their addition to the game as an operating body upon which the wider real games that are downstream of culture units are based on We have reached a phase of development where the salt of the earth makes the best culture memes because we are the ones who shoulder shoulder suffering You d need military grade training and still often make less viral memes then organic ones without artificial power structure support Essentially think of this of a movie culture of which The People pick the constituent archetypes scene by scene in realtime It s everything a government is sans the bureaucracy logistics and corruption This is a truly unique and interesting cultural artifact The information war is a rigged game We lose by consenting playing the rigged game we win by setting the game Were not in an information war it s closer to a knowledge war which may might seem even more daunting but creativity can be a big player here vs battling big tech and if we start playing the knowledge game while they re still playing information game they won t be able to compete because their entire empire is based on manipulating information and if they were to try and train their slaves in knowledge warfare they would end up setting them free The information war was lost before it began due to asymmetric metaphysical limitations The information war is a farce Below that is a mystery gnostic luciferian power structure based on the manipulation of knowledge Both the knowledge game and the information game are asymmetric but in opposite directions this is why they want people to think this is an information war because it s the only one they can win Plays like a mixture between yugioh INWO and Magic Most similar to Magic except memes have a board locality virulence mechanic which indicates how far the effect of the Meme jumps to adjacent connected targets Infrastructure is like a defender creature in Magic except that it also has health Infrastructure of corresponding resource color is required to play 7 resource cost Anthropos creatures indicated by the golden dragon around their rightmost cost alternatively you must offer sacrifice an Anthropos from the Matrix Avatars determine your Time life points for the game the unique win condition and your special ability for the entire game This way 2 decks with the same cards but different Avatars can employ completely different strategies and have different objectives Memes are essentially spells Board position is important

dubs immediately locked out of the site with a never before seen false error message hours later the physical cards were delivered 4 days early I can attest that the synchronistic anomalies with this thing are stubbornly awesome persistent too long to list This tool is a mustard seed a most peculiar cultural artifact it is a mechanism to use asymmetric memetic feedback loops to immunize the

boardgames,My Background At home when I 34M we mainly played 2 types of boardgames roll and move monoply the goose game and knowledge based games trivial pursuit some dutch dictionanry game While I liked playing with my family board gaming was not my main favourite activity Later in my life Catan came out and I was triggered a bit more because for me at the time this game had theme But when I played it the first time I was about 11 years old very unaware that board gaming was considered a hobby So during the years I played mainly with my family the same games Until about 4 5 years ago I bought Legends of Andor this was the real eye opener for me a game that after all the others had so much theme in it I played through all the scenarios in 3 days or so After that I weant on searching for something that was less of a puzzle and more lets kill some monsters type of game For that I found Castle Ravenloft but the real change was during this research finding out about BGG and a lot of Youtube channels about boardgames All of which led me to the rabbit hole that is the hobby My latest revelation in this is Facebook groups for secondhand games which does not save me a lot of money but does increase the amount of games I can get for the same amount of cash Player profile My main playing partner is my wife I like complex games with lots of theme in them and my wife likes more thinkier games with streamlined rulesets Favorite games in collection Mansions of madness 2e Above and below Teotihuacan Raiders of the North Sea Trickerion Newest games in my collection Second hand Comanauts Ashes Rise of the Phoenixborn Robinson Crusoe Andventures on a cursed island First hand Photosynthesis Gizmos Trickerion Teotihuacan Treasure in my collection Trickerion Most wanted games right now Cartographers A Roll Player Tale Architects of the West Kingdom Clan A Deck Building Advneture Ecos The first continent Dinosaur Island Storage Solution Ivar shelves from Ikea an attempt to copy box throne Storage Solution Here s my collecion feel free to ask me question share you thoughts or give me suggestions on what to get next does not have to be on my most wanted list Not in the pictures Ticket to ride Europe Catan Deluxe amp x200B https preview redd it jj5u92ft1sp61 jpg width 2034 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s bb649bcffd806b82c7f705a8e1e44ed10b976414 https preview redd it 132is3ft1sp61 jpg width 4608 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 30c7c0e9707cd5418f55b1f3f1e3f0760cfd1bbc https preview redd it 0cayuyet1sp61 jpg width 4608 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s a9f16979a64b70d886464c22812772d44233ef95 https preview redd it zl2t9fft1sp61 jpg width 4608 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 61435dcb49306f90a366c9409bc5df7b5726b645 https preview redd it 3gpmq2ft1sp61 jpg width 4608 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s d7e8e46856ba625212422fea59d7606a49aaffdc COMC It all started with Legends of Andor,502,2407,2908

boardgames,The last couple of games of this have left a pretty sour taste with both me and my gf and we are unsure if it s due to the way we are playing some issues with the game design and balance or maybe war games are just too confrontational for us Would appreciate opinions from more experienced players on which it is likely to be I tend to attack a lot and focus on trying to remove her counters while she is a little more proactive with trying to take tiles Last night we had a slog fest scenario 3 where I felt like I was super far ahead the whole time but after an hour and a half kinda blundered and we ended up both pinned with equal objective points but she had momentum so won I was pissed because I was left scratching my head as to how I ended up losing and I m not sure she felt it was a particularly satisfying win Today we played scenario 4 and I was the US so started with snipers so I was again quite attack heavy what with that being the snipers main strength This time I did manage to grind her out and this time she was super pissed while the snipers felt kinda OP to me and it felt like quite a one sided fight She reckons I m not quite playing in the spirit of the game because I tend to not really proactively go after tiles instead trying to dwindle her army down to control the board But that has often felt like the best strategy to me and I know war games are quite attritional Maybe we are just both not quite understanding the appeals of the genre this being our first war game of any description maybe the direct conflict is just too confrontational However I do have a few issues with the game itself There seems to be an overall advantage for the US and I ve seen some data that supports this on a BGG forum even if the advantage is slight there is a statistically significant advantage for one player in several scenarios Some of the scenarios especially 3 feel wayyyy too long again maybe this is an issue with my playstyle although neither of us have even utilised the Scout s Conceal action which I imagine would only prolong the game and make it more grindy A 90 minute playtime for one scenario is too much for what feels like a pretty die dependent game Now I appreciate you often make your own luck in games and for the most part the combat system works more or less as intended But out of our 4 scenarios we ve had one game that was genuinely decided from 2 lucky consecutive rolls early on and 1 other scenario where die luck sung wildly in a way that ended up making the subsequent gameplay feel a little unsatisfying for both of us I just can t shake the feeling the games take way too long for a game that is essentially given determined by die rolls So what is leaving the sour taste is it our fault either for playing the game wrong not in the spirit intended or for not embracing the confrontational nature and die dependency of the game Or are there genuine issues with the game itself Undaunted Normandy Are We Doing it Wrong,576,2393,2968

boardgames,I recently got a chance to play Quetzal on Board Game Arena Overall I really enjoyed my experience with the game though it fell short in a few places Mechanics Quetzal is a unique work placement bidding game that has players rolling double sided meeples to determine their starting resources each round On one side you ll have archeologists the other adventures Both types have specific spots on the board they can go to as well as a couple of shared spaces where either archeologists or adventures will do the trick I found this mechanic to be much more than a gimmick as the types of meeples that you and your fellow players roll will help determine not only where but also when you should place your meeples While some places on the board can be activated by a single Meeple other places will require you to have majority which can be lost if another player can place a higher number of meeples I found this mix of bidding and worker placement very enjoyable Another nice piece of tension was its scoring system Some places will allow you to collect cards on the board that can later be turned in for set collection scoring However it costs meeples and currency to to score your cards so you want to do balance these to actions Theme This was the game s biggest disappointment for me The Indiana Jones Aztec theme felt a little weak Also while there was almost no flavor text to setup the game s story it was clear that we were simply stealing ancient artifacts from the island and packing them onto boats to sell I think there was a missed opportunity to have a more exciting colorful and fun theme for this game Graphic Design The game board s jungle green mixed with wood brown and paper tans did little to make it pop After everyone places their meeples worker placement spaces must be resolved in a specific order I was expecting the order of resolve would be from left right top bottom but the sequence turned out to be a little bit of a tricky maze I m not sure why they laid it out that way amp x200B If you have played Quetzal I d be happy to hear your thoughts My First Impression of Quetzal,391,1714,2104

boardgames,tl dr What s the most interesting space for interacting moving etc in a game that you ve encountered I m an academic cartographer GIScientist gosh I hate that term and due to some lucky coincidences like the pandemic making field work impossible I have a bit of funding to study spatial models in games While my colleague on the project and myself have a fairly well developed set of materials to focus upon we ve obviously not played every board game out there I thought it might be fun to ask r boardgames what their favorite game spaces might be and look into picking up games that I might not have While just your favorite map is totally appreciated I m more asking about how space is modeled for interaction in the games For example the way that Guns of Gettysburg uses detailed study of the terrain to create a pseudo time travel based board or how High Frontier attempts to model energy requirements for travel In truth if you just have a favorite board game I d love to hear about it in as much detail as you d like to share If you re super interested in the larger research project feel free to DM me Your favorite spatial model or just map in a game,219,941,1159

boardgames,I m a little lost with the strategy behind this game and I was hoping someone could help me out a bit I ve played LoW twice now and both times I ve been absolutely crunched 4th out of 4 people yesterday with the 3rd place person 30 points ahead of me I ve played worker placement games plenty especially Agricola and I m usually right near the top but for some reason I can t get a handle on LoW For some extra context yesterday we played with the Skulldeep expansion and I played as the lord who wants Warfare and Piety quests There were none in my opening hand so I worked on the quest that gave me extra black cubes for going to the inn Once a Warfare quest popped up I grabbed it and kinda followed a pattern of collecting cubes for the quests in hand until someone reset the quest board and flipped more relevant quest types Where I started to get lost was when other players were completing quests worth 20 25 points the turn after finding them since my little 8 12 point quests took me at least that long to complete This was the pattern for the rest of the game with the others seeming to get twice as many points as me for the same number of meeple placements After the game I asked for advice and all I got was You just need to gather more cubes but there wasn t anywhere to do that There weren t any decent buildings and I took advantage of the Skullport spaces when the resources they could give me were relevant to my quests One of the other players told me I must have gotten unlucky but blaming my results on luck feels like a cop out It feels like there s something I m missing as far as the strategy here Can someone give me some pointers Lords of Waterdeep What Am I Missing,332,1361,1692
boardgames,Spirit Islands looks and sounds like a great game and most of my gaming time is either solo or with my wife so this sounds like it would be a good fit Only thing that has stopped me from purchasing the game is the complexity is showing at a 4 01 just seems intimidating considering most of the games we play are games like Viticulture and Wingspan Both under 3 My wife isn t huge on brain burner games but wanted to get other people s opinion on how accurate the complexity rating is for this game Is the 4 0 misleading at all does it not feel as complex as that rating Is there something else not really shown that leads to this complexity rating Any input would be greatly appreciated Im on the fence on buying this one and just need a little push towards one way or another Thanks Spirit Islands complexity rating on BGG,158,666,823

boardgames,So my girlfriend _loves_ all things fantasy She seems to read through some new seven book fantasy series every week and our bookshelves are overflowing with them And yet when it comes to boardgames all she wants to do is trade in the Mediterranean Which is fine we have a lot of mid weight Euros that we both like But I d also love to find something that appeals on a more thematic level I think a big part of the reason she hates most fantasy games is that she despises combat as a mechanism which means dungeon crawlers and big epic war games are out of the question Doesn t matter whether the combat is player vs player or players vs game either by the way She does like stuff like Everdell and Belfort which are sort of fantasy themed but more focused on building things I think she d also appreciate something about magic but in a non combat setting I ve had my eye on Res Arcana but I don t know of any others So what are your favorite fantasy themed board games that don t include any kind of combat or war Non combat fantasy themed games,202,844,1045

boardgames,So I love the Witcher IP I love the sword combat I love the characters the lore Literally everything That being said I m having a hard time nailing down The Old World and wether it is going to be good or not I think it s to early to tell but I d love to hear some opinion on the latest video if you ve seen it In this video they talk about combat between monsters and other Witcher s I wasn t sure how I d like combat I do prefer dice just because there is that luck factor but I did enjoy the card mechanics in something like Journeys Through Middle Earth Although dice is what I prefer I think I can get behind the deck building mechanics and combat mechanics in this one because it really allows you to set up those really nice combos for a powerful attack I also enjoy that it s the other players that get a chance to control the monsters when you are fighting as a Witcher I really think that s a good call otherwise there s a potential to have some really bored players at the table I was initially worried about the Witcher bs Witcher combat though because I figured if you were playing 4 players it would suck to be the other 2 players just waiting around but it seems that combat could be rather quick with some experienced players On top of that just from the brief mention of it in the video it seems they put in a betting system so you can bet on who you think will win the fight which will have players a little more invested in what s going on at the table instead of sitting there on their phones while they wait for their turn Anyway that s pretty much all I have to say about this weeks video I m really looking forward to see the main board and how the actual exploration will look What s everyone else think about this game so far Anything you re looking forward to or anything you ve seen and been disappointed in so far New Witcher Old World video is out,372,1504,1875

boardgames,Hey All About a year and a half ago I posted this bar chart race watch v I DTg_ EKRk amp t 5s amp ab_channel EranHirsch of logged plays at BGG throughout the years I was actually collecting the data for what i m posting about today but bar chart races were all the rave My real project though was to find out what games are good at what player counts The idea was simple BGGs own community based recommended player count is an opt in poll Even very popular games have a disproportionately low participation in this poll making it extremely biased and somewhat misleading There had to be a different way BGG also has logged plays and these logged plays also have number of players this was what I was looking for BGG doesn t provide an API to easily fetch exactly this information so I built this project to scrape logged plays efficiently eranhirsch bgg_players_count But looking at a single game didn t give me enough information If a game is played at 2 player 30 of the time is that good or bad The next step was to scrape everything I expanded my code and let it run for about a week feeding it game IDs I scraped from a top 2K ranked games and b top 2K games ordered by number of rankers I then filtered out games that didn t have enough data points 1000 meaningful logged plays meaningful being that they also have the players segment filled The end result is this file BGG Player Counts Google Sheets spreadsheets d 1Vp8e4FpILk6dBTbJRiR4DCAvBRCOMYGrZQ1xwEUtdVk edit usp sharing To make analysis easier I used conditional coloring to create a visual cue of how good or bad is this ratio in for this player count why The assumption is that each player count is more or less likely to be played without regard to the specific game If a game is good at 2 and 3 players it would most likely be played more by 2 players because smaller groups are more likely to get together and play but how good it is in that player count is a factor of how similar games are played In other words if almost no game is has plays at 10 for 6 players those 10 mean much more than a game that is played 10 for 2 players This all sounds confusing but it actually looks like it works We can see that games renowned for being 2 player optimized like Race For the Galaxy Castles of Burgundy or Santorini have a high 2 player ratio but other games like Scythe or Terra Mystica have low 2 player ratios It s even interesting to see that Codenames and Decrypto have almost identical biases towards even player counts stemming from the fact that they split groups into 2 So how do you use this file Pick the player counts you are interested in from the tabs at the bottom i ve recalculated the data separately for each play count as it slightly changes the ideal ness If you are interested in games that are suitable for more than one play count let s say 2 player and 4 player use the range tabs 2 4 in this example Find the game you are looking for and check out the colors If the play count you are interested in is Green that s great If the play count you are interested in is Red you might be better off checking out a different game Notice that if the colors are faded or almost white it s not a bad thing it means that this game is pretty good at all player counts Just for fun I cut the data separately for some other interesting cases at the end Top Ranked Top Played Games from 2020 and Board Game Arena games Notes I normalized the data based on BGG published player counts and kept it simple so that games that have extra player support via expansions won t be represented here You can see for example that Catan is billed as a 3 4 player game It was too complicated to take those factors into account Looking at the data critically we can also see that some games try to match a larger set of player counts than they should missing on all counts These games would just show up red where they could have been greener Like The Crew s 2 player variant On the other hand some games are so good at defining the player count that all play counts are Green like Puerto Rico Use this data as a tool not a system Some games might be ideal at a different player count but fun for your group regardless I play a ton of Innovation at 3p and some games might seem perfect but are just not fun This is not a recommendation system it should be used as a way to steer from making clearly bad decisions Would this game be fun at player count x A comprehensive list based on actual logged plays tries to answer this question,860,3635,4494

boardgames,So I have been buying Red Dragon Inn stuff for many years now I have even bought a couple of the collectors editions when in Kickstarter and have scoured looking for promos I just recently got the new Evil Pooky expansion in foil and I started sleeving up all my decks in clear Dragon Shields to protect them Due to this I have started running out of space in the Smorgasbox and the 5th edition box as well With all the accessories and coins that keep coming out I have nowhere to safely keep it and I end up not being able to take all of it to Game Nights with the family I have found a sorting box online but it seems to cost anywhere from 300 to 500 bucks I am not against getting a custom box for such a thing I just worry that eventually it will also be outgrown and will need replacing Is there any ideas for having a good way to sort protect and keep all RDI stuff in one well protected container I have been looking to find a way to pay someone to custom make a box but I wouldn t even know where to start Red Dragon Inn Sorting Box,209,832,1040

boardgames,With my reinstated love for Root over the last few sessions I noticed that probably Root is the game that causes the most table talk in our group People constantly politicking giving unsolicited advices making downright threats backstabbing and all the laughter perhaps makes this the most noisy game that we ve played And it s consistent this way play after play Which game does this for you the game that causes most amount of table talk Which game causes the most table talk,84,394,477
boardgames,Does anyone have a good recommendation for plastic boxes or bins for storing board games I d like to transfer a few dozen games into long term storage but don t want to put them into cardboard boxes or leave them exposed in their own Since the storage space won t be climate controlled garage or basement I ll have to try and weatherproof the box if it isn t already some bins have a foam seal and throw in some desiccant I d think that a great size would a multiple of the standard game box size 12 x 12 x 4 So a 12 x 12 x 24 box for example would fit 4 6 at a time and not be overly heavy or hard to move The reason I m asking here is that looking around is proving pretty tedious without just getting a giant tub So many are tapered and only list overall dimensions so it s hard to know what the inner dimensions are I d go to the store and shop around but the pandemic makes that an unappetizing idea My hope was that someone here may already have a great solution and could recommend something Thanks Plastic Boxes for Storing Games,208,830,1037

boardgames,I have scoured google BGG And beyond and have yet to find a board game similar to EFT I know it is a niche game but there are so many elements that seem like they could be incorporated into a board game What I am looking for Firearm combat customization Board games seem to steer clear of firearm combat Maybe because of lethality or desire for more fantastical elements I am looking for a game with good gun combat Preferably pvp I am also interested in customization It seems like something a board game could utilize really well with stat boosts losses based on certain attachments I know there are other elements such as looting hideout management flea market etc but those seem like they could be other games entirely What I am looking for is gun combat perhaps with looting elements and pvp Any thoughts Board games like Escape From Tarkov,152,694,845
boardgames,Hey r boardgames Our podcast Dice Pirates us podcast the dice pirates id1533877181 is going to be covering the legacy of Fantasy Flight Games and the issues that seem to be plaguing them in recent years Asmodee s purchase of Fantasy Flight Games in 2014 in retrospect feels like the beginning of the problems for the company and the departure in recent years of Christian Peterson and other long time employees as well as the reported layoffs are very troubling FFG has long had a history of publishing fantastic games and providing support and backing to them for quite some time regardless of whether the game was widely acclaimed Runebound being a good example here Lately however FFG seems to be primarily focused on their licensed products such as Star Wars Marvel and Arkham Horror For a company that produced and supported so many fantastic and unique board games and that championed the LCG concept it is sad to see them moving to a more corporate position While it feels like most of the blame could be focused on Asmodee we d love to hear your thoughts on FFG and where things may have started to change for them Or if you even think they ve declined at all FFG still produce some fantastic games and while they may have moved away from some of their more unique games they still put out good products and continue to support several of their larger products We love FFG and a lot of their games Twilight Imperium is still a favorite for vacation days and we keep revisiting their games How do you guys feel about FFG What happened to Fantasy Flight Games,281,1285,1565

boardgames,amp x200B Howdy My name is Mackenzie Franklin owner of SideGameLLC in Colorado Springs Colorado I own a personal game night service here in the Springs where we bring games from a large library to teach and play One big thing that I prioritize is getting games started quickly and that all comes down to the organization of the box itself I have a lot of videos on my Youtube Channel dedicated to this very thing I thought I d share my 3 biggest tips when I organize games 1 Plastic Bags are the worst The amount of time it takes to open a bag and dump the contents into something stacks up so incredible fast It s annoying and time consuming to take out and it s annoying and time consuming to put away Containers of any form that also serve as a bowl or plano style organizers are your best friends The best of these come from the Dollar Tree or any local dollar store where you can get lots of small containers art supply organizers or tool organizers that will fit various components There s nothing better than opening a single lid and having 12 individual components already sorted and ready to go Plastic bags can still be used obviously if needed but when you can get rid of them 1 Reduce the amount of boxes What s more time consuming than rifling through multiple boxes If you can fit everything into a single box logically and without destroying anything do it I will gladly take an inch of lid lift if it means I can open a single organized box Sometimes it can t be helped having things in multiple boxes but when you do make sure it s logical how you re storing things in those boxes All expansion content in one box all characters decks all the miniatures etc Don t be afraid to get a larger box for a smaller game if it just isn t working It s about getting the game played 1 Inserts and Storage that come in the box are not always the best Goodness gracious there are some terrible inserts that come in games Granted a lot of them are just there to keep things safe during shipping but if they don t have spots for sleeved cards or have you taking a bunch of extra time taking little pieces out of deep wells I ll pass Throw away these inserts and don t look back Sometimes having 4 plastic bags I know right with all the player components in them is all you need Don t bother with printing or buying inserts that complicate things in order to look pretty Also sometimes modifying the existing insert can be your best bet Don t be afraid to cut an insert to keep the useful parts while throwing away the rest I hope some of you find this useful If you want to see how I organize games or just my thoughts on games in general check out my channel here channel UC6lTVrsAHTtebWZ4jyeXHHg Also I have a collab video this weekend at 10 AM MT with The Broken Meeple talking about our favorite campaign games if that interests you Organizing your Games Tips to Get Games Started Quickly,549,2347,2895

boardgames,Some deck builder games like Dominion you pick 10 different cards and those 10 to build a supply that everyone gains cards from from All other cards which is a great many depending on how many expansions you have besides the 10 are excluded Other deck builder games like Star Realms instead there is a big deck of cards and the supply is just drawn of the top of this deck Every card is in the deck for every game Has anyone tried using the Star Realms style mechanic into a game like Dominion Does it work Does it break anything This would make games less predictable but also save a lot of time on setting up each game as you just pull out one stack and shuffle it good for every game Specifically I am thinking of applying this to the game Puzzle Strike where I just mix all the cards 5 of each unique type into one deck technically all the chips in one bag and use a supply of 10 random different ones duplicates in the bank would not count toward the 10 It seems like a huge time saver for casual play Mixing deck builder supply mechanics,201,843,1043

boardgames,I think that most board game hobbyists have been aware of price creep But I am curious in regard to board game prices relative to inflation Yes there are games being sold today at prices that seem high historically speaking but are those prices actually just keeping pace with inflation or outpacing inflation Is there a way to find out how much Clue Monopoly and Risk were selling for in 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 so that I can see if mass market games are keeping pace with inflation outpacing inflation or falling behind I am more curious on how hobbyist designer games fare in relation to inflation However there are not many of those that have been selling continuously from 1980 to the present Diplomacy and Cosmic Encounter are two that I can think of Modern Art has been around since 1992 so one could get a decent picture of how it has fared in relation to inflation as well I am not sure what other hobbyist games would be good candidates to reveal the long term impact of inflation on the hobby If anyone can shed some light on this issue and or point me in the direction of a website that has archival retail prices of mass market and or hobbyist games that would be great Board game prices,222,980,1201

boardgames,I loved board games as a kid but no one really influenced me or encouraged Started with the usual monopoly dabbled in DnD then backed off until about 6 years ago when I dove in head first and discovered how deep the rabbit hole goes Catan Shmatan I have been building my solo game empire more recently due to this pandemic thing hasn t everyone and it s been very rewarding So many interesting solo games out there to play From the insanely complex GMT stuff to the adventures and dice rolling heartbreak of Ignacy games to the weird and wonderful kickstarter stuff like Gate and Dark Venture I love the artwork and components and organizing them this gets me really excited about the hobby It allows everyone to have their own spin and upgrading these components is a hobby in and of itself I love fiddling with bits and chucking dice I just love this goddamn hobby so much Can t wait to be able to play with my friends again soon If I could go back 20 years I would have told myself to start sooner and to be a little choosier with purchases I think I have a lot of unique games but a ton of overlap and some titles that just don t really excite me anymore I m looking at you Machi Koro Anyway thanks for looking and happy to answer any questions or give suggestions Here s the main shelf These games get the most play https preview redd it bfbia85xsen61 jpg width 1706 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s d7d38a3841f63554862ce7e3ec9fde1b66be62fa Here is the pandemic chest with party games and games that don t hit the table as often covid banishment https preview redd it yn2vp3p9xen61 jpg width 3104 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 2da3aaa644f61fc8f9a7219114fb26b0acce206b And finally the closet with games yet to be played possibly to sell or too big for the shelf Closeted collection https preview redd it ur28dkxexen61 jpg width 3103 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s ae5d8204fe4950d9baaf0f0d58b35feec89ae26a Not pictured Gloomhaven I ve been in the hobby for about 6 years and I ve plateaued at 182 COMC,364,1655,2018
boardgames,The base game of It s a Wonderful World is superb Exactly what I want out of 7 Wonders but shorter and leaner easier to teach The only downside for me is that card drafting games are best utilized with a large group and base IaWW caps at 5p Luckily the expansion goes up to 7 I d like to get the KS edition from my flgs before they re all gobbled up but I don t know if we ll have 7 players until our usual groups are all vaccinated That may be many months from now The game is good at lower counts too but if all the expansion does is add complexity I have other engine builders for that Is the expansion worthwhile for solo 2p for now Is it worth it to rush to get the KS edition or is the best stuff in the regular expansion Thanks for any thoughts anyone has Would also love to see feedback about the expansion itself Is there any reason to get the Corruption amp Ascension expansion for It s a Wonderful World if I don t anticipate playing with a large group for a while,197,779,975

boardgames,This has been on my mind recently and I d love to hear some thoughts from the rest of the community How do you think the overlap between board games and video games will evolve in the future We re already seeing More board games getting video game conversions Board games getting more placement at gaming events like PAX East and PAX West Video games being adapted to board games the Divinity game comes to mind for one More board games experimenting with AR or companion apps and other tech And this story ing a desirable skillset in the video game space Yes there is a ton of similarity between those fields of design but I also think there are some unique elements there that maybe a typical video game designer might not be strong in With boardgames and tabletop growing and with video games overlapping more and more where will this go next Are there parts of this potential that haven t been explored yet Will these trends continue and strengthen or do you think they will pivot at some point How will the connection between board games and video games evolve in the future,196,884,1079

boardgames,I m looking to entice an 8 year old into strategy board games and wanted to get some opinions out there on 2 fronts amp x200B 1 Suggests on an introductory strategy board game for 2 players for ages 8 I did a quick search and came across a list that had some promising options kids 8 year olds A couple of games that caught my eye were Kingdomino and Magic Maze However when I looked at Kingdomino I saw they had a Kingdomino Duel version I m pretty sure most of our gameplay will be me and the 8 year old but we do have more people that could possibly play with us I just want to make sure that a game that s advertised as 2 4 players is still really enjoyable with only 2 players For instance I ve played 2 player 7 Wonders which is clearly meant for 3 players for awhile before getting 7 Wonders Duel for a real 2 player experience I don t want that same experience when picking out a game for an 8 year old 2 When reviewing the pictures of Kingdomino I saw that the pawns are standard looking pawns I m wanting to buy a separate set of pawns or figurines that look more realistic Think D amp D style Again the idea is to entice the 8 year old to engage with the board game with cool pieces that they can use their imagination with So I m looking for suggestions of where I can buy detailed figurines that may be used in future gameplay of other board games Specifically a variety of classes i e Warrior Thief Priest mage Paladin etc instead of race Humans orcs elves dwarves etc though I m not opposed to having a variety of races if I can t find classes Any ideas and thoughts to make the board game experience come alive would be great Thank you Request Strategy game for an 8 year old,334,1358,1691

boardgames,I was just looking through my collection and I realized that most of the recent games I ve gotten have just been good or fine The last year I got that truly and honestly wowed me was Spirit Island which is now 4 years old A couple other that year were close as well Gaia Project and Twilight Imperium 4 were amazing as well but after 2017 it really seemed to nose dive for me Don t get me wrong there s been several games I had fun with but the only other sort of recent game I got that I really clamored to play again was Teotihuacan 2018 While I don t want to just hate on Kickstarter since I think some quality has genuinely come from it it seems like the only thing mattering now is component quality often taking the lead to solid game play 2011 2016 really seemed to be the sweet spot for amazing games for me Through the Ages 2nd 2015 Scythe 2016 Feast for Odin 2016 Terraforming Mars 2016 Eclipse 2011 Castles of Burgundy 2011 Concordia 2013 7 Wonders Duel 2015 Orleans 2014 all wowed me in ways I didn t think were possible More recent titles have all kinda just left with a that was fun enough reaction rather than a Let s play again reaction or even just a I d rather play x designer s older games It s not for lack of trying Some of the more recent lauded games I ve played are Gloomhaven Jaws of the Lion 2020 The West Kingdom Trilogy 18 19 20 Maracaibo 2019 Underwater Cities 2018 Hallertau 2020 Tekhenu 2020 Sleeping Gods 2021 Cryptid 2018 Wingspan 2019 Root 2018 7th Continent 2017 It s not that I don t think these games are good they are but they just seem to lack a bit of a wow factor for me and out of all those games I d rather play something on my first list amp x200B Even looking at the BGG top 50 or so there s only a couple games that have been released post 2017 I know it takes awhile for people to play and rate them but it seems like there s a bit of a fall off happening I know I won t like every game I play but it seems like there s less that s even appealing to me and it s getting more expensive to give a game a shot 60 used to get me a huge game and often 40 50 would be enough Is the Board Game Renaissance Over Or am I just growing out of the hobby,445,1744,2188

boardgames,In Struggle of Empires 2 7 Players take the role of one of the major powers of the 18th century and fight in both Europe and the colonies over the course of three rounds or wars In each war players must form into two alliances Once allied with a player you can not fight each other for the duration of that war At the end of each war area control will be assessed in 11 territories and victory points will be awarded accordingly Control is established by control markers which are mostly a fixed resource each game Depending on the player count there will be a certain number of neutral markers placed on the board at the beginning of each war Other than that after the initial placement of player control markers at the beginning of the first war control markers can only be gained by attacking other players control markers If you win their marker is removed and replaced by one of yours There are a lot of choices that the game s mechanics require you to make First and foremost since you can not directly attack an ally the auction mechanic dictates a lot of what you ll be able to do during that particular war Allies can but are not required to lend support to combat strength for allies during battles Negotiation is encouraged and can lead to some interesting moments The alliances also can affect your expansion decisions as well due to the location of each nation s control markers and troops on the map A hotly contested victory point region from one war might be completely silent in the next due to shifting alliances Gold and economy are super important and it always seems like there isn t enough If ever you do not have enough money for something you want to do you must tax your population For every 2 gold that you need you most draw an unrest token which is bad Unrest tokens range from 0 2 with the vast majority of tokens being ones If a player has 20 or more unrest at the end of the game that player is eliminated Players with less than 20 will lose victory points if they have the most or second most unrest at the end of the game And since money and actions are so intertwined unrest hangs over every decision you make There is luck involved and the dice can definitely crush you But the dice rolling mechanic encourages you to build up your strength BEFORE rolling to increase your odds because the dice can never increase your strength by more than 5 points Struggle of Empires is not for the light hearted gamer But if you have a group that likes some intelligent fisticuffs and can remain friendly after 4 5 hours of thoughtful strategy and quick deadly combat I bet you should have a lot of fun For my full review with video and pics https youtu be FLCVV5zU1X0 Struggle Of Empires Deluxe My Take,505,2221,2725

boardgames,Now that they re run by Asmodee it appears that FFG now have a return policy that mimics Asmodee s sadly I traded for a full set base game and all expansions of Eldritch Horror but it s missing a few cards Yes I could return it and cancel the trade but before I resort to that I wanted to at least try to get replacement cards first The problem is their policy now is to put the responsibility on the store that sold the game In this case it was a trade and even the person I got it from likely was not the original purchaser Am I out of luck then I ve checked the BGG stats for Has Parts and no one seems to have these 4 particular cards Outer World encounters btw BGG really needs to police that feature as 90 of the has parts are not used to showcase extra parts they have available I have no idea how to get these cards other than printing proxies which is a far inferior solution How do stores replace parts anyway Do they get the parts from Asmodee and then distribute these If so maybe I could reach out to a local or online game store to see about this Or does Asmodee just assume the store has to issue a full return and not provide replacements FFG s new return policy anyone used it yet,239,959,1197

boardgames,Hi y all I ve always liked board games but recently I have been trying to introduce some new ones to my gf and so far I ve been successful with games like Jaipur Lost Cities and Ankh or I have a few more games in my list that sounds similar to the ones we have played satisfy conditions to earn victory points etc However I was thinking about getting something different maybe some kind of dungeon crawler I like the idea of working together fighting baddies as we get more powerful equipment etc Competitive would be fine too I really need something that is easy to learn It would be great to find something that I can learn first and then teach her Pluses Simple rules but still requires strategy Last less than an hour Not a lot of text on cards tiles Relatively compact and affordable Mice and Mystics is on my radar but I m afraid too much text on cards can be scary for a newcomer Some kind of dumbed down Zombicide maybe Looking for a light dungeon crawler,183,781,963

boardgames,Today I had a discussion with a friend about types of board games and what type of games requires which type of thinking We were playing Fallout Shelter which is a worker placement games I have a great dislike for these games because I am horrible at strategic planning since I can not keep an eye on all the different kinds of elements that generate resources and that does allow you to do all kinds of stuff I can not plan 2 turns higher in my head Also once you are behind you can never win This frustrates me Also I suck at concentration which does not help Paradoxally I am very good at games that allow you to make a snap decisions with the current the possibilities that lie on the board I often win games like Spendor Its a wonderful world and R because I can see in just a second what I need to achieve what I want to achieve It is the fact that Im good at adjusting at every moment without planning ahead that I win If its fast paced the more exciting it is Do I was wondering why I do enjoy the latter and not the first What makes these kind of games different or similar Im curious Is this a right observation or do you have another opinion Let me know Strategic vs Tactical Games,233,960,1192

boardgames,So I have been rewatching the original Yugioh series and am now in the Dawn of the Duel arc in ancient Egypt I realized that the shadow game being played between the Pharaoh and Bakura would make a really cool board game Here is a brief summary of the situation for those who either haven t seen it or need a refresher The setting is ancient Egypt On one side is the bad guy Bakura who is trying to summon Zorc the lord of darkness to envelop the world In order to do this he needs to collect the 7 millennium items and place them in a special tablet The good guy the Pharaoh is trying to stop Bakura from collecting all 7 items to prevent Zorc from being summoned The 2 players essentially control multiple units on the game board some are grunt units and some are much more powerful Each player also has unique once per game abilities For example Bakura has 3 special abilities reverse time freeze the movement of his opponent s pieces and start an alternate countdown to summoning Zorc regardless of whether he collects all 7 items Both sides have grunt units but the main battles focus on Bakura facing off against the Pharaoh s Court which include the Pharaoh and 6 guardians each of whom holds 1 millennium item Bakura and the Pharaoh s Court are able to summon monsters to do battle against each other Whenever someone s monster is injured or defeated the monster s controller loses hp When a unit s hp reaches 0 they are eliminated from the game Both sides have multiple win conditions Bakura needs to either eliminate the Pharaoh or successfully summon Zorc which is not an instant win but whose summoning is incredibly hard to overcome similar to the end stage of Eldritch Horror The Pharaoh either needs to defeat Bakura or learn what his true name is which is the key to defeating Zorc Translating this to board game mechanics the good guys are on a clock due to the alternate summoning condition of Zorc however Bakura might be able to summon it earlier giving him a huge advantage There would be an element of moving around the game board searching for clues to learn the Pharaoh s true name as well as both sides fighting over control of the 7 items There is also direct combat involving the players and their summoned monsters doing battle when they encounter each other on the board Bakura starts off fairly strong but each time he defeats an opponent his monster grows stronger This makes it harder and harder to defeat him in combat as the game progresses Each player would have unique once per game abilities to gain a substantial advantage when used properly I m imagining this would be a grand strategy type game with numerous strategies and goals being pursued In my research War of the Ring comes closest to this idea Frodo is trying to sneak around the board and destroy the Ring Sauron is trying to get the Ring but there is also a backdrop of area control and military conflicts Looking for a game that is similar to the final arc of the original Yugioh series,545,2443,2987

boardgames,Hey everyone I ve been in the board gaming hobby ever since I was a kid I played Avalon Hill games back in the 1990s I remember being introduced to Settlers of Catan over 20 years ago I remember attending my first board game convention Gencon back in 2005 It s been incredible to see the hobby explode and the production quality of board games skyrocket Anyway I ve always been a fan of rail games including Ticket to Ride And I m someone who enjoys blinging out his games I ve upgraded my favorite games with metal coins inserts and in some cases even painted minis But I ve always been disappointed that there weren t nice miniature trains that I could buy to upgrade the wooden and single color plastic trains in my favorite rail games So rather than just complaining about it I decided to do something about it After a year of work I m proud to have created Deluxe Board Game Train Sets We launch on Kickstarter April 6th They re a line of five train sets each highlighting a train style from a different period in railroading history Each set comes in a metal tin with original artwork and contains 48 highly detailed multicolored plastic trains and a stackable wooden score marker We ve been able to capture detail on these trains as small as 2mm yes 2 10ths of a millimeter The trains fit just about any train board game And if you re a fan of Ticket to Ride these trains fit any standard Ticket to Ride space and perfectly fit in the plastic insert that comes with any standalone Ticket to Ride game You can visit the website at www littleplastictrain com to be notified on launch day and automatically be entered in a drawing to win all five train sets assuming we fund of course We ve made full production samples of one of the sets The Mercury and uncolored prototypes of the other four trains I ve attached renders of those trains and their tins so you ll see what they ll look like when they re made Ugh I know that sounded like an ad Sorry about that I m just excited to share what I ve been working on nights and weekends for almost a year now and thought some on this subreddit might be interesting If y all have got any questions I m happy to answer them My passion project Deluxe Board Game Train Sets,420,1800,2219

boardgames,In Struggle of Empires 2 7 Players take the role of one of the major powers of the 18th century and fight in both Europe and the colonies over the course of three rounds or wars In each war players must form into two alliances Once allied with a player you can not fight each other for the duration of that war At the end of each war area control will be assessed in 11 territories and victory points will be awarded accordingly Control is established by control markers which are mostly a fixed resource each game Depending on the player count there will be a certain number of neutral markers placed on the board at the beginning of each war Other than that after the initial placement of player control markers at the beginning of the first war control markers can only be gained by attacking other players control markers If you win their marker is removed and replaced by one of yours There are a lot of choices that the game s mechanics require you to make First and foremost since you can not directly attack an ally the auction mechanic dictates a lot of what you ll be able to do during that particular war Allies can but are not required to lend support to combat strength for allies during battles Negotiation is encouraged and can lead to some interesting moments The alliances also can affect your expansion decisions as well due to the location of each nation s control markers and troops on the map A hotly contested victory point region from one war might be completely silent in the next due to shifting alliances Gold and economy are super important and it always seems like there isn t enough If ever you do not have enough money for something you want to do you must tax your population For every 2 gold that you need you most draw an unrest token which is bad Unrest tokens range from 0 2 with the vast majority of tokens being ones If a player has 20 or more unrest at the end of the game that player is eliminated Players with less than 20 will lose victory points if they have the most or second most unrest at the end of the game And since money and actions are so intertwined unrest hangs over every decision you make There is luck involved and the dice can definitely crush you But the dice rolling mechanic encourages you to build up your strength BEFORE rolling to increase your odds because the dice can never increase your strength by more than 5 points Struggle of Empires is not for the light hearted gamer But if you have a group that likes some intelligent fisticuffs and can remain friendly after 4 5 hours of thoughtful strategy and quick deadly combat I bet you should have a lot of fun For my full review with video and pics https youtu be FLCVV5zU1X0 Review Of Struggle Of Empires Deluxe,505,2223,2727

boardgames,I ve played Monopoly on iOS for a couple of days mostly because the PC platform is dead Winning is pretty easy with average players and not so terrible luck i don t trade anything until the board is mostly bought up ii trade to gain leverage and 1 good monopoly In the past few games I ve mostly been interested in a different way to play Monopoly THE MOST VIOLENT AND TOXIC GAME EVER The idea is that instead of doing everything you can to fuck everyone over keep the rent reasonable and have everyone grow in wealth overtime In the last 2 3 games I ve basically obtained unbeatable positions monopoly and funds for 3 houses when no one else has anything similar and tried to keep everyone in the game by donating funds buying and then donating property to help everyone else get color sets tearing down houses so that people can afford rent etc In the last game there was an AFK player that was really annoying for the first half of the game but came back later and I literally gave him both the brown and green sets for 1 And I did similar things for other players The problem is I ve never had luck with making it work in the long run A few people clearly got onboard with the idea but there s usually one bad apple who start building as soon as he get any money even though there is ZERO threat on the board to him and everyone else is CLEARLY benign Any thoughts on this I thought it d be cool to have everyone build their portfolio and accumulate wealth by building roughly equal number of houses to prevent anyone from going bankrupt Does someone always have to die Cooperation in Monopoly iOS,304,1298,1601

boardgames,Tonight my wife and I played Fallout Atomic Bonds for the first time the cooperative expansion for the Fantasy Flight Fallout Board Game Despite the mixed reviews the base game has received I was always fond of the experience you got fighting your way through the wasteland exploring leveling up and working your way through the quest deck As a competitive game it never quite hit the ground running thanks to the unpredictable winning mechanic amongst other things and yet where the base game fell short Atomic Bonds takes this game across the finishing line so well it s a wonder Fantasy Flight didn t launch with this rule set Atomic Bonds is a fully cooperative expansion that quite literally transforms the Fallout Board Game into a more engaging and satisfying experience for those who might have been discouraged by the base game mechanics In this expansion you side with one factions as you work your way through that faction specific quest line as well as trying to complete an additional set of goals in order to win Of course there are a few additional cards decks added to keep the game interesting such as mutation modification and workshop cards You also gain a nifty assist die so that your fellow wastelanders can help out in combat providing you stick close together The addition of C A M P tokens allow your party to set up fast travel way points for navigating larger maps more easily Each of these additions corrects the flaws that were present in the base game and bolsters the best aspects to elevate the overall experience into something that you ll want to bring to your gaming table time and again If you haven t picked up this expansion set yet I highly recommend that you do I have only good things to say about it Fallout Atomic Bonds Expansion Breathing New Life Into A Flawed Game,321,1490,1810

boardgames,Hey everyone So I just bought the base set for Bloodborne s board game as well as the Hunter s Dream expansion and while I m super excited to dive into the game I have some questions about the game itself and I figure you smarty smart smarty people will more than likely have the answers 1 So for combat I know that it s dependent on the cards you use and whatnot Let s say combat occurs against an enemy while I have two cards in hand either from me attacking the enemy or from them pursuing me Also let s assume I use the two cards in my hand for the fight and both the enemy and myself still have health remaining after my cards are used up My first question is this does the combat end at that point and go to end of turn procedures Or does the enemy just get to keep attacking me on that turn until I m dead To my understanding you can t fight without putting down cards and the rule book says you don t get to draw a new hand unless it s a new turn or when visiting the Hunter s Dream 2 According to the rule book if you have no available spaces on your weapon to play cards you can t fight the enemy and have to just take the blows I know that one of the actions you can take on your turn is discarding a stat card to transform your weapon but similar to my first question once the fight has started if your slots are filled up are you just stuck with the enemy attacking you over and over until you re dead I know both of these questions sound similar but I don t think the idea of combat was explained super clear I get the idea of a back and forth fight but nothing mentions what occurs in a fight when you re out of cards even if you have empty spaces on your weapon I m sure the answer is something obvious but I d love some clarification Bloodborne Board Game questions,362,1421,1782

boardgames,Hey everybody I m working on a University English assignment about a copy of Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat from 1925 and written into it are some scores from a few different games the owners played I was wondering if anybody would recognize what kind of game they would have been playing The one I m most interested in seems like the objective was to play four rounds where each score has a maximum of 100 points and you re trying to get as close to 400 as possible In the first image you can see scores like 82 90 98 94 adding to 364 400 and 82 83 89 and 75 adding to 329 400 The best score was 100 100 100 99 for 399 but they re all recorded over 400 at the end Another game they played seems to be three rounds or maybe they only played 3 one person had scores of 12 18 and 14 for a final of 44 and the other had scores of 21 16 and 12 for a final of 49 This can also be seen in the first picture The last game is also the biggest longshot In the picture they ve kept track of wins losses draws for four people places entities It s probably just some random folks names but if it jumps out at you let me know If any of that is even remotely familiar please let me know what that seems like to you Thanks for any and all help you can provide Processing img uhqx7tuw0wm61 Processing img 98gautuw0wm61 Identifying old games from scores in a 1925 Tom Swift book,276,1088,1363

boardgames,Games like Risk Unstable Unicorns Here to Slay Monopoly and Red Dragon Inn are great but they all rely a lot on luck Even a board game like chess you have to randomly or arbitrarily decide who goes first which can be a noteworthy advantage Are there any that are just strategy The only game I can think of is Stratego Wikipedia https en m wikipedia org wiki Stratego except to decide who goes first each player reveals a piece and whichever is higher goes first obviously players don t want to reveal their 10 or may choose to go second by revealing a 2 Since players build their sides to protect their flag or deceive their opponent this would be a perfectly strategic game with a fitting name Two other potential examples people brought up to me were Battleship Wikipedia https en m wikipedia org wiki Battleship_ game and Boggle Wikipedia https en m wikipedia org wiki Boggle My issue with Battleship is that there aren t as strong of motivations when you re placing pieces Don t put them next to each other don t put them in predictable places like corners As a result even though it isn t truly random firing off shells in a diagonal pattern can seem pretty aimless Because there s not as much room for actual strategizing it ends up feeling random It s more wild guessing than educated guessing Boggle is basically just a single player game where people compare scores not so much a strategy game Another kind of game that could work are social deduction Mafia esque ones where players have to lie convincingly or deduce who s telling the truth I d like to omit these because players are randomly assigned roles and there are a ton of them TL DR Most board games involve some sort of luck Are there any that don t Thanks Are there any purely strategic board games,325,1445,1769

boardgames,This is less of a question and more of an off my chest I love co op games because it s a good kind of stress solving things together or working towards a puzzle or goal that isnt another person I m good at that sort of thing puzzles risk management odds calculation strategy so I m very good at co op or solo games The problem is i m very aware of this and even though I have the right answer It s hard for me to choose when to present it or when to let them solve it Knowing their answer is wrong I don t want to sound narcissistic but I believe it s important to recognize your strengths as well as your weaknesses I want to win these games with my friends and I don t want to throw the game because I don t want to quarterback and cause them to have less fun but winning together is also part of the fun and part of the fun for me as well Trying your hardest and succeeding is a great feeling as a team I want to know about anyone s thoughts on this Does anyone have the same problem being too good at something and not giving it your all How would you feel if a player did this being an opponent or a team mate Just to clarify I m not talking about picking up people s pieces and moving them and telling them thats the best move next turn I mean when an obstacle is presented you know the best option for that situation You know how many cards are left in the deck you know which way the AI will move the monster and they didnt think of that You are good at math or riddles so those last 5 escape room questions were already solves most of the time How to be less of a co op quarterback,328,1263,1590

boardgames,tldr there are no real official rules on character selection right First off having an absolute blast with this game But after losing twice in January and worrying we were doing something wrong to make it too hard on ourselves we have won 5 straight and I am worried we are doing something wrong to make it too easy on ourselves I love an unforgiving game and frankly miss the January days of getting our asses beat Granted we did come very close to losing in June our first 0 funding game gt also our first game with the expiremental vaccines but we didn t even use any lt But specifically the last 5 games Or at least the last 3 going off memory we have used the same 3 characters gt Operations Specialist Quarantine Specialist and Medic apologies if those aren t the exact names Along the way we ve unlocked the Soldier and Colonel but while we definitely see their value in dealing with faded figures we ve luckily been able to keep that situation pretty well under control so far lt With that combo of characters though this game that was once kicking our ass has been relatively simple although I do feel we ve gotten a little lucky in some regards So my general question is am I missing any rules about character selection I realize that if there s not but we still wanted to challenge ourselves we could just pick different characters but and here s where I ll cop to being a bit of a stinker the main group I play with likes an easy win and I like more of a challenge If I pitch a let s mix it up for a challenge it won t go well and I ll happily cede to the group but if I were to realize we shouldn t be allowed to run the same 3 characters every month per the rules they ll happily acquiesce to that the same way I d happily acquiesce to the majority s wishes if there is no such rule Thanks everybody Also a very minor question not worth including in the tldr but is bugging me and since I m here also big apology because I am doing this from memory and likely have some details wrong gt Operations Guy doesn t need to discard a card to build a military base The Formidable upgrade means you can discard an adjacent city card to build a structure instead of that city s card When drunkenly deciding on upgrades we decided that meant since Operations Guy doesn t need a card to build a structure period Formidable would mean he could build a structure in an adjacent city for an action the same way he could in the city he was in This is a nonsense reading right I think we basically wasted Formidable on the 1 character who truly does not need it It s saying you can use an adjacent city s card instead of the city you are in s card but he doesn t need a card at all so womp Right lt Pandemic Legacy Season 1 Spoilers Through June,535,2209,2743

boardgames,This topic is inspired by u eriktwice s excellent discussion ments m3ijhz the_alpha_player_in_coops_is_a_symptom_not_the of alpha gaming in coop games I see a lot of people saying alpha gaming is about poor social interactions and or alpha gamers need to just not be alpha games It seems to me that we need to go deeper to talk about this There are two types of alpha gamers AG here Type 1 Inept or inexperienced group gamers they don t know either how to manage the information they share or how to negotiate social interactions in a group game These are both learned skills but they are social skills rather than gaming skills This group often contains people who are just not pleasant to play with because of the way they interact with others in condescending controlling or otherwise inappropriate ways Some do this deliberately and that is another problem worth talking about but many just don t understand their impact on others Type 2 Skill differential in gaming some gamers are more experienced more tactically minded more familiar with the game at hand etc Even if these gamers are exceptionally adept at negotiating social situations and group gaming they can still cause problems simply because they are operating on a different level than those they play with This skill differential is what I want to talk about Full disclosure I tend to be an alpha gamer in the second sense although I m sure I m not always a perfect person to play with in the first sense Regardless of the games we play unless there is a high degree of randomness I tend to have a win rate of 70 or better It doesn t matter who I play with or how many players I play with that rate remains fairly constant The first time I played Race for the Galaxy I won over the person who owned the game and taught it to us Connected to this is that I tend to be the rules lawyer in my groups I have pointed out rules errors in games I have never played simply because I have a strong meta understanding of games I notice something that seems inconsistent with the game design and call it out Most people would call me highly intelligent but I believe most of my skill comes down to experience I have been playing games of various sorts for my entire life and I am familiar with how they are structured and how to negotiate and manipulate the elements of a game system to excel This is not to brag but simply to give some context My problem is this Many people blame alpha players for disrupting group dynamics and ruining the fun for other players While this may be appropriate for Type 1 AG it is not appropriate for Type 2 AG Skill Differential This is the equivalent of saying My fun in gaming depends on not encountering any player who is substantially more skilled than me If a player is substantially more skilled they should keep that to themselves in order to allow me to enjoy the game Now this might be a legitimate solution to the problem if all players can agree to it the same as a parent choosing to play Candyland with a child However if the person in question is simply better at gaming and looking to test and grow that skill it is unfair to expect them to consistently sacrifice that experience for the sake of the group This is cutting off the tall poppy In competitive gaming this can turn into aggressive attacks against that player simply because they always win While this might be effective at preventing their win it can easily turn into bullying targeting a player simply because they are perceived as superior regardless of their performance from game to game In co operative gaming there are no obvious ways to cripple this player so the general response seems to be that they should cripple themselves in order to allow for others enjoyment This hardly seems fair or productive One might suggest that the other players should take the opportunity to learn how to work with someone how is simply better at a thing then they are If you are at work and someone who has been doing the job for years starts telling you how to improve you should listen It doesn t mean you should let them walk on you but they are sharing their experience in hopes of seeing you learn and grow in your work The same applies to gaming Sometimes people tell you what to do because they don t know any better or because they like telling others what to do Type 1 but sometimes they are doing so in order to share what they ve learned and see you excel Type 2 Distinguishing these two modes is a critical life skill Conversely some people are offended when anyone demonstrates greater competency than them whether they perceive it as limiting their choices or they simply can not admit their limitations This is hardly more adaptive Healthy social interaction requires learning to negotiate differences of skill commitment experience passion and social awareness This goes both ways Now there are a few things I ve learned that help me play better with others First as many have noted put that energy and experience to use in teaching and guiding other players into new play experiences This may involved participation but it might also mean simply teaching others to play a game for themselves However this may be limited by group size and by the desire for participation rather than just supervising others Sometimes I just want to play a game Second set artificial limits on your play This is something I ve learned from training longsword with masters far more skilled than myself If you are interacting with someone less skilled than yourself recognize that and decide what you want to gain from the experience Often I will set out to pursue a strategy I have never tried before simply to see if I can make it work Of course this means I prefer games which support fairly open ended game play rather than tightly reactive problem solving types of games I regularly win at Agricola but I can t stand how it demands very specific sequenced gameplay I much prefer things like Race for the Galaxy Great Western Trail or Terraforming Mars Instead of focusing simply on winning focus on expanding your knowledge of the game Continue to be curious about what is possible This may mean certain games simply aren t worth your time and that is another challenge to negotiate with a group As a highly skilled gamer it is difficult to find opponents who consistently challenge me Part of negotiating this with various gaming groups has meant open conversations about the kinds of gaming experiences we find enjoyable Some games allow for experimentation and others demand more reactive gameplay Figuring out what works for everyone takes effort Part of the reason we love games is because they bring us together but this social aspect to gaming requires effort and learning as well If your dynamics are difficult because of an alpha gamer it is worth asking whether you are being a supportive and positive group member rather than simply assuming they are they problem because they are better than you Their behaviour may be problematic but yours may be as well Negotiating this tactfully and respectfully is something gaming allows us to practice in a variety of contexts Try varying your games and looking for experiences that help each person to grow TL DR Sometimes alpha gamers are jerks but sometimes they are simply excellent players Expecting excellent players to play in a mediocre way to allow you have fun is not fair If you can t have fun because someone in the room is smarter or more competent than you that is your problem not theirs Learning to negotiate that skill differential is part of the social learning and experience of gaming with others Honest conversations about what we re each looking for is important to healthy gaming or any social interaction Negotiating Skill Differentials in Gaming,1380,6404,7783

boardgames,do Everdell with Bellfaire exp Fav new mechanic,8,40,47
boardgames,First of all let me preface this by saying a few things I am pretty critical of game design and mechanics and pretty jaded pessimistic of new releases especially Kickstarters which tend to be flashy but ultimately mediocre gameplay wise Although I like to play mostly anything barring just straight up bad games and co ops my favourite games are low luck euros and economic financial sims 18xx Splotters Bullet lt 3 is none of these and yet is feeling like a strong 9 10 and rapidly shooting up to my fav games of all time Bullet lt 3 is inspired by the colourful and intense Japanese bullet hell SHMUP arcade games specifically the magical heroines of Touhou and while its visuals and Spotify OST which is incredible and adds so much to the play experience convey that aesthetic if I were to describe what it s like to play I d actually say its a mix of The push your luck draw from a bag and potentially bust tension feel of Quacks of Quedlinburg The intense real time spatial arcade puzzle game feel of Tetris Bust A Move Peggle Candy Crush Bejeweled and relatedly The addicting satisfying feel of combos and clearing obstacles of classic arcade puzzle games like the ones aforementioned Players have their own personal bag filled with random chits the titular bullets that have both a colour 5 different colours and a number on ranging from 1 to 4 These chits are super chonky wooden tokens in the deluxe edition think of the Quacks acrylic geekbits then multiply them by 1 5 On your turn you can draw a bullet and place it in your grid in the xth column where x is the colour of the chit y spaces down where y is the number on the chit Naturally as you place more bullets of the same colour the column will fill up and overflow bullets that overflow deal damage and if you take too much damage you die lose The main way to clear these bullets out of your grid is by playing pattern cards which require bullets of certain colours numbers to be in a specific pattern formation in your grid Some bullets have a star on them and clearing those out of your grid will reward you with refilling your action points Action points are a precious resource you can use to trigger powerful abilities some unique to your character like drawing more pattern cards and very frequently used manipulating the position of already placed bullets in order to set up for the pattern cards in your hand The first twist I like Bullet lt 3 is played in REAL TIME in successive rounds where you receive more and more bullets that inevitably overflow your board and kill you Every decision feels like it has weight and every time you play a pattern card and clear bullets it is eminently satisfying Admittedly the game only has a teensy bit more player interaction than Quacks mostly heads down on your own board with random exclamations of cheers groans save for this brilliant second twist bullets you clear move into your opponents bag for the next round much like sending lines in Tetris and the last player standing wins in the standard competitive mode there s also solo time attack co op boss and 2v2 team mode Bullet lt 3 is simple intense and satisfying Managing your limited action points to set up for maximum value clearing pattern cards is such a STRONG gameplay hook The real time push your luck aspect is just icing on the cake for me and my tastes personally Drawing more bullets out of the bag makes patterns easier to achieve and clear but also brings you closer to death There are 8 different characters with VERY unique playstyles that feel interesting rewarding to learn and master and substantially asymmetric If you enjoy any the puzzle arcade titles I listed above you will LOVE Bullet lt 3 It reminds me of the time I got introduced and subsequently addicted to playing PVP Tetris online Ultimately this still feels like its own unique game with its own fledgling IP I m a fan of anime but not really into anime art for my boardgames The quality of the art in this game however is excellent Better than most games based of actual Anime IPs It is sharp and bright reminding me of a neon lit arcade machine The graphic design is clean and superb in QoL for usability for players You know its good graphic design when just looking at the game set up makes you already have a gist of how it plays and gets you excited to play it Finally it s the little touches that just make this game the total package for me How each pattern card has campy ridiculous Japanese anime yell your attack as you perform it burning booster v 01 no jutsu name with a silly anime one liner flavour text How each heroine 8 in the base game apparently more to come has its own theme in the Spotify OST How the playable characters have a b side that becomes a thematic boss which mirrors their asymmetric ability playstyle in the co op mode Playing this game made me feel happy as a gamer consumer because I could feel the amount of work and attention that went into this game from the designer and publishers I seriously recommend you give this game a try I saw many people on this sub overlook this game citing distaste for the art fair enough anime isn t for everyone but this is a solid and satisfying competitive real time puzzle game that feels unique to any other board game I ve played It s impressive how well they ve translated this digital video game genre onto analogue tabletop My final point is that I played this on Tabletop Simulator before I backed it I thought it was neat enough to back and was a fan of Level 99s stuff anyway but didn t think too much of it later Playing it in person is completely different with the tactility of the bullets in the bag especially the big wooden chonks adding so much Finally the game is easy to teach set up pack up and play time is literally lt 20 mins since each round is timed It completely caught me off guard by how much I enjoyed it since it feels like it came out of the blue and has just made me excited about what board games ofc Level 99 games and this IP continue to have to offer when I thought I d seen mostly everything Worker placement deckbuilding for spring Ground breaking s Bullet

boardgames,One of my favorite board games is 7 Wonders Duel as I love the idea of having multiple ways to win through military science or victory points Of course the game comes down to VPs usually but I love the feeling of having the play multiple fronts to prevent the opponent from getting too strong in military or science to get the win It creates a sort of balancing act where sometimes you have to play sub optimally and refocus your attention to one of those fronts just to deny that advantage to your opponent But if you focus too hard on one of the fronts your opponent might just snatch the win from underneath you through a different one The idea of different victory conditions and having to balance multiple things dividing your focus is a really appealing game mechanic to me but I m surprised that more games don t do it Or at least I can t seem to find them Aside from drafting and deckbuilding games are there any other games that have this balancing multiple fronts ideas amp x200B Star Wars The Queen s Gambit seems to have this idea with 4 literal fronts you have to focus on for advantage but given its price point I don t think I ll ever play it in my lifetime I was looking into Risk Star Wars Edition too with its 3 fronts but some of the fronts seem like afterthoughts and the strategy seems too basic Open to any suggestions Or at least a discussion of this mechanic in board gaming Games with Multiple Fronts Win Conditions,271,1170,1440

boardgames,A lot of board games have been converted to videogames Which ones do you think keep the same feeling and which ones were you hoping for but ended up falling short For me I noticed a lot of games didn t have the same multiplayer numbers as the actual physical board games Such as uno is only 4 players Where as Lords of Waterdeep which is a bit more complex still can have a good number of players Id like your thoughts on good and bad conversions to digital and WHY you feel that way Thanks What are your favorite digital conversions,102,432,533

giving players many games to play with similar lore Volfyirion Guilds is a fast paced deck building game for 2 players and plays around 20 40 minutes Again this is a standalone game so players will not need to own any previous titles but it also can be combined with Volfyirion amplifying the classic game Already know about Volfyirion Guilds Visit Tabula Games now to check out things further amp

events included in the game Volfyirion and about 60 years before the events in the game Mysthea This story focuses on 5 major guilds all created by the king of Mysthea In the beginning these guilds were both small and big Houses formed to pursue the common goal It s important to know that one of these biggest and elite guilds was formed and managed by the Volarees family even though there were also many other smaller families associated with this guild With time the system that the king created brought a silent war of power among these guilds with the focus on the Volarees Guild Disputes arose between between guilds and the strength of Volarees increased more and more with other guilds or houses disappearing including Rorius house The king being a visionary and intelligent man knew it was time for a political challenge He empowered other guilds making sure that Volarees would not be the only powerful force inside his kingdom His purpose was to divide the power accumulated by the Volarees House without releasing retaliations that could potentially undermine the entire political stability of his kingdom Before the king made a huge move he studied out the dynamics between the various families of Ilvash including their passions and weaknesses that could change the entire challenge The story continues as a new Qoam field is discovered at the bottom of one oof the farthest floating islands of Mysthea that hosted a very unique flower Telron a talented young Qoam manipulator identified unique properties within the petals of that flower When those petals are turned into pulp and then burned it produces fumes that induces divinatory powers when inhaled Telron was granted ownership of the new field from the scholar guild and Volaress claimed ownership for the discovery Both the scholar guild and Volaress discussed ownership of this new discovery with one side claiming the importance of studying it and the other the property rights of it The king saw this and decided to rebalance powers among the guilds redistributing lands forming 5 guilds Varorin the Guild of Merchants Volarees the Guild of Nobility Lusma the Guild of Faith Kaetur the Guild of Soldiers Magista the Guild of Scholars Years later the guilds fight for power using guerrilla and sabotage techniques With time luxurious palaces were transformed into command centers and were called Vaults for the secrets that were stored inside them With time it was then mandatory to enroll in one of the guilds that represented that citizen s interests But with these changes fighting between guilds for political and economical power arose ignoring the real needs of the population amp x200B https preview redd it 6h0ri5l90bm61 jpg width 3840 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 17e3934fa07a6a86175faee85ea5b861188a0fc1 Mechanics Volfyirion keeps all the mechanics used in the base game with an addition giving the game more depth The game includes 110 new cards including new card types new abilities and some additional mechanics The main engine in the game is a system that uses points Each card that s played provides a combination of points and during a turn the player can spend those points to perform actions In the game there are three types of points command wonder and knowledge Each of these points will allow for different actions to take place Each player will start with the same cards but players will refine their deck to match their strategy to win the game In addition the cards have a system of colors that offer synergies to trigger powerful combinations and unleash chain effects amp x200B https preview redd it 6svsa1ab0bm61 png width 2418 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0e06eb9d6c39c606636c1dd800230e750d2b49e6 What s New with the Mechanics If you are familiar with the base game then you might be wondering how this game differs form that one Volfyirion Guilds introduces two new card types Agents and Vaults These card types also introduce new mechanics into the game Agents these cards will carry out delicate tasks for the guilds to perform These cards also help reduce the randomness of the deckbuilding helping to find ways to acquire certain cards and to improve the management of that turn Vaults These are the most important areas of a guild s command center They contain all the secrets and valuables for that guild These cards enhance the strategies and choices for players but also remove the whims in seeking the conditions to trigger a specific combo But these all come with a cost as the vault s abilities are unlocked when their owner loses a city This helps the player who is at a disadvantage to be able to catch up to the runaway leader leading to a more balanced match Ways to Play the Game Remember Volfyirion is a standalone game but can still be combined with the base game Volfyirion As would be expected if combining the game it will change the game giving players different actions and an increased variety of cards Also like the base solo and coop modes will be available with a renewed feel to them It will be possible to not only face Volfyirion creatures but also other creatures of Mysthea The game will come with tarot cards the include the specific rules for these modes amp x200B https preview redd it 2c3eof4d0bm61 png width 3000 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 50b3eb2c014ea4b8e8279937a671433367eda47b Highlights of the Game It s a fast paced game that only lasts 20 40 minutes with intense turns of lots of actions and decisions The game is easy to learn and takes almost no time to setup yet hard to master as the game is highly strategic and every choice with have a significant impact on the turnout of the game The game is also highly replayable and isn t repetitive as you can choose to play your cards in many different ways combining cards to create synergies and focusing on different paths to victory The new features in this game will increase the depth of an already very well liked game adding in new cards with new abilities and new mechanics Again you can play Volfyirion Guilds as a standalone game or combine it with the base game Volfyirion causing a different gameplay you can play solo or competitive Additional content and extra rules are going to be released during the Kickstarter campaign so we can hope for some nice surprises as well The Dragon Miniature Word has been passed down that the 120mm dragon miniature will also be available not only for those interested in backing Volfyirion Guilds but to anyone interested in the dragon

boardgames,I played Mysterium for the first time yesterday expecting to have a great time seeing all the wonderful reviews My excitement quickly turned into panic after my role as ghost was found very difficult The cards I picked and even the new cards after dumping my hand were not good at first glance I found myself mulling over which cards to pick while everyone sat watching me and doing nothing The whole game ended up with me panicking trying to pick a card while the psychics were bored out of their minds my mom expressed this openly which made me more anxious to pick cards I eventually started shuffling through the whole deck trying to pick a card that made any sense for the psychics to interpret The whole thing was a complete disaster and I walked away angry at my mom for being such a bad sport and angry with myself for buying such a boring game I really don t want to regret buying this game It was expensive as hell and there s been so many good reviews What am I doing wrong Did anyone else feel the same about Mysterium Mysterium Hard Being the Ghost,199,863,1061

boardgames,Sometime during quarantine I hit close to critical mass in my collection I don t have that many games left on my wish list so I started to allocate my funds into blinging out upgrading my favorite titles Part of that was creating inserts While I m not opposed to bags as you can see in the pics I hate them for components Players unloading their own pieces isn t a big deal but I wanted everything else to be easy These greatly reduced setup tear down in such a huge way I can t see myself going back When I get a game now I factor in creating an insert as part of the cost I have quite a few games to go but I thought I d post my early work and give a few tips for others who want to give it a try It s really not as hard or as intimidating as you think Scythe a J0Jfzo2 Quest for El Dorado a ytwxpUY Mezo need better bags a 5yYqff6 Bloodborne KS a 7VcrPqx Blood Rage KS they said it couldn t be done a Ngfsw8A Materials used Pins with round heads Elmer s All Glue Cutting Mat Stainless Steel Ruler What s Next Rising Sun KS oh boy Great Western Trail The Others Core Box Mission Red Planet Lord of the Rings Journeys in Middle Earth Quick Tips Don t spend a ton of time measuring out your cuts You don t need to draw out lines either Just be careful about lining things up do a small practice line to get a groove and then do a finished cut with a good amount of force Glue a small piece of foamcore under flat cards or carboard player boards Makes them much easier to get out Plan Plan Plan Creating a blueprint for your insert is often one of the trickiest parts of putting together a box In fact for Blood Rage and Quest for El Dorado the plan took almost as long as putting everything together Be meticulous here Everything should have a place before you glue anything together When planning don t forget to measure the board and rules You do not want to get everything together only to find out the board sticks up out of the box Trust me When gluing I go a little heavy with big drops and then smear them on the surface with my finger I find this creates a better seal for the finished product Just be sure to keep a rag paper towel handy While you can use books to weigh things down I like to use pins to hold everything together while the foam dries This largely comes down to personal preference but I found pins to be a bit tighter and more accurate in the end My biggest tip When cutting pieces always cut bigger than you need and shave down This allows you to get a tight fit without too much risk Going a bit long for walls or cutting wider and sloppier for bottoms just to get a smaller piece to work with is extremely useful I found trying to perfectly measure the first cut leads to issues and a lot of wasted foamcore I typically cut a wall about two or three times It takes longer but is worth it if you want clean pieces Thanks for reading If you have any other questions just drop a comment Foamcoring My Collection Part 1,583,2362,2944

boardgames,I think a few of us in Oz will be looking at Game Steward to buy some games that are hard to find locally if you missed a Kickstarter I recently bought some stuff from them and thought I d share my experience for others Price bought Honey Buzz Deluxe Version that version wasn t available locally and retail was still not available Based on prices I m seeing online I paid 100 above the base game retail price to get the extra stuff shipping Having said that this was a relatively light and small package so shipping will go crazy with larger packages Time to Delivery took exactly a month from the day I made the purchase and arrived at my door It 10 calendar days from the shipping status to change from Received shipping information to In transit to destination So hard to tell whether the package was dispatched at any point during those 10 days or if it took them 10 days to get the package picked up Having said the above at the time of purchase COVID was going wild in the states and it was winter and some of the worst winter storms were hitting parts of the US I m not sure if that contributed to longer shipping times than normal but they must ve been a factor Mine was shipped with the cheapest postage option Maybe in normal times you might get your package in like 10 business days or something Packaging It was pretty well packaged they use bubble wrap where each bubble is like the diameter of our 20 cent coins The box itself looked fairly banged up especially the edges but due to the good packing all the contents were fine Conclusion Shipping times aside which again lots of stuff going on in the US when I bought it so definitely a factor pretty happy with the results If the game you want isn t available anywhere but the US based on my experience I d say you can trust them Might cost you a lot but at least everything should arrive in good shape Game Steward Experience Shipping to Australia,361,1554,1914

boardgames,It started 6 months ago when the second lockdown hit Maybe it would be better if me my friends family would play more games together I spend some money on simple board games that wouldn t scare anyone away The fear kicked in what if they dont like the first game then they wouldn t want to try anything ever again So I decided to look further and bought some more games One of these would stick I thought to myself I finally mustered up the courage to introduce the first game to my family It was a succes and they wanted to play more Now there had to be some more games with a bit more depth becouse these simple games might get boring after a while More games were bought just in case Then FOMO hit hard I had to get the games in my native language That would be easy to teach Concordia went out of print I really would have wanted that in my language That could happen to other games on my list Buy Board games don t go bad I convinced myself These games I will definitly want to play somewhere in the future doesn t matter if that will be in 20 years or more And then I checked my bank history and added the numbers close to a thousand euro s in 6 months Then I realised something was wrong and I promised my next purchase would be when I can buy my next 4 games on the wishlist at once that would be Oceans in my own language Canvas Queendomino and Undaunted Normandy Hopefully Oceans will never recieve a translated reprint COMC incomming when my latest order arrives with the release of Sleeping Gods I m usually very strict with spending currency but this one crept up on me I have acquisition disorder and I just found out,317,1315,1631

boardgames,I ll start by saying that I do enjoy Eldritch Horror and Mansions of Madness a lot I bought every single expansion for those two titles even though some of them remain unplayed due to current obvious reasons When I got into the hobby finding stuff for Arkham Horror 2nd Edition was a bit too late and too expensive from where I live I do own the original though just never tried any of the expansions I do enjoy it but found it to be too sluggish for my or my group s tastes I ve read that some expansions do solve some of the problems but I think it s a bit too late for that Now that the third expansion for Arkham Horror 3rd Edition I m really perplexed whether I should give it a try I know all about Arkham Horror LCG bought the core set and Dunwich Legacy w o Mythos Packs but I m somewhat reluctant on starting collecting it since while it s a very engaging game it s a huge investment if you want to collect at least the core cycles Plus it s also somewhat of a treasure hunt finding and buying older packs today So my question is whether Arkham Horror 3rd Edition is an engaging game and different enough to be enjoyed by someone who doesn t consider himself an Arkham Files devotee even though I do own a lot of those games Or should I embrace the fact according to most reviews that Arkham Horror LCG is a much more worthy game Is Arkham Horror 3rd Edition worth checking out,271,1116,1386

boardgames,So about 10 years ago I played a game my area s public monthly board game meet up I played this game that could serve a higher player count Unfortunately since this was a fairly large meet up that happened I can t even recall who brought the game or who I played the game with When I went back to college I remember it was simple enough that with some Pandemic pawns and a simulated board I could teach it to my friends Alright here s what I remember of this game It played a really high player count I wan na say 8 10 players I believe one player was secretly the spy or traitor or something to that effect Every player had a colored pawn on the board but on your turn you didn t need to move your pawn the board was a number of houses that looped around they were numbered 1 10 except for the last house which was the evil house and maybe their was a bonus house that was good But simple board with 11 12 large spaces On your turn I think you could move a pawn the number of spaces that was on the house they stood on Maybe you were scoring points it was an older game so in 2011 I remember thinking the copy I played looked like it was printed in the late 1980s The theme was these brightly colored houses that looked early 20th century There might not have been a traitor In fact I think everyone s color was secret and on your turn you moved any pawn you wanted and it would score the space it landed on So the strategy was to get players to move your pawn to the high scoring spaces while moving other players pawns to the Blackened house Any help on finding this game would be greatly appreciated Looking for help remembering a hidden role style game I played a long time ago,334,1349,1682

boardgames,I had an idea for some Catan rules I d like to bring to life and a felt this would be a good sub to ask for advice So my friends and I were playing Settlers of Catan and we started talking about how rng heavy it was and how we could make it more strategic and less luck based Somebody always seems to get screwed over by the dice and it leaves a salty taste in everyone s mouths afterwards I had the idea of using dice with a different set of numbers so you could shift the probability in your favor when rolling I feel this would remain fair because you wouldn t guarantee hitting a specific number and could accidentally end up hitting somebody else s wheat on 9 rather than your stone on 10 I found a good shifted distribution that keeps all numbers possible and leaves 7 as the most likely number for the robber s sake Low Roll 1 1 1 2 4 6 with a standard d6 High Roll 1 3 5 6 6 6 with a standard d6 The player could choose which set of dice they use before rolling each turn or potentially pay for the rigged dice with a sheep so sheep actually find a use I feel that this would offer more strategy around using lower and higher tiles leaving fewer obsolete spaces and offering the player more choice in the game As a bonus if you use the high and low rigged dice together it gives you a 12 in 36 chance of rolling a 7 a 3 in 36 chance for each even number and a 1 or 2 in 36 for the rest I like to call it the anarchy set for those who are desperate to move the robber I d love your guy s opinion on any potential game play problems I m being blind to I do understand the anarchy set is a little out there or any other changes ya ll know of to make the game less RNG based Also does anyone know where could I buy standard pip dice preferably custom color with customizable numbers on all sides I m having trouble finding anything that s not just stick you logo on the 1 face I m trying to re balance Catan to be less RNG heavy and would like some opinions on my solution,405,1572,1976

boardgames,My brother in law and sister have introduced me to Clank Legacy and I ve been greatly enjoying the game He was polite and offered me the use of his deck and went with a basic un modified deck instead giving himself a handicap of an extra coin to start the game with They had already completed the campaign and this is in the post game scenario with their now permanent changes It feels a bit off to me though to have a player so thoroughly handicapped though at the post campaign mode and am wondering if anyone has any additional insight or experiences to share about playing Clank Legacy with a potentially rotating group for the post game If say I go through the campaign with three players is there a fair way to have built a fourth deck that mimics the average power gain that the players who actually went through the campaign would have gotten How about the Upper management or C Team expansion characters Is it worth picking one of those up so a guest could have a better experience while affording the regular group to keep their personalized decks suited to their play style For what it s worth a number of other members of my group have been incredibly squeamish about legacy games making permanent changes but as the one planning to buy this copy I fully intend to adhere to the rules and properly destroy cards I m told to I m excited by the prospect viewing it the same as the pain of having to release a pokemon who fainted during a nuzlocke Changing out or adding players to Clank Legacy,279,1225,1503

boardgames,There was some hubbub on BGG last week about the depiction of women in games It seems a common trope to have women in poses to show off their curves while fighting bad guys obviously the best time to try to please some men Considering that a ton of fantasy games have these images of women as a standard I thought it would be cool to curate a list of games that DON T use stereotypical art to portray women What can you all think of A few fantasy games I can think of are One Deck Dungeon Too Many Bones Lord of the Rings Journeys in Middle Earth There are lots of cards so I could be misremembering Gloomhaven I would like to discuss this a bit more I think I haven t seen all the art but I remember Childres made a point of changing the art to make women have practical armor Except for the cover where the idea is the character is dressed to make an impression on the town List of Games That Don t Stereotype Women in Fantasy,184,745,928

boardgames,This is my first board game outside of the classics such as monopoly and battleships and all those older games I ve found that if you go first in Dark Edition you seem to have a huge advantage This might be the case for all different versions of the game that I haven t played but from what I m seeing if you go first and start in Tokyo in the 2 player rule set its very hard to be forced out amp x200B Staying in Tokyo has a huge advantage with getting a head start on energy pooling while the other player is trying to roll smashes in an attempt to force a yield before they get too far ahead Meanwhile the person in Tokyo that s farming energy can roll for their wickedness victory points as the other person is trying to roll attacks amp x200B I played a game where I was unable to enter Tokyo even once due to the other person getting ahead healing from cards and doing double damage to me I had to focus on staying alive and at this point it wasn t an option to even try getting them to yield I played defensively passively getting victory points with the herbivore card as I knew there was no moving that rock of a player but ultimately died to an attack that did 7 damage amp x200B I tried looking for information about this but there seemed to be no one talking about it which makes me wonder if we re just not playing it right Thoughts on the advantage steamroll King of Tokyo Dark Edition snowball,275,1134,1408
boardgames,I m looking to set up an after school board game club at the secondary school Ages 11 18 I will be working at I m just wanting to field your suggestions on what games would be good for it To help below I ve got some general criteria of games I m looking for Playtime around 40 minutes to an hour no longer than 1hr 30 minutes Even though I m passionate about the job I do want to ensure myself and students get home at a reasonable time Considering splitting games into 3 categories based on length and complexity Class A Big games for students to play they must arrive on time and start setting up quickly EXAMPLE Terraforming Mars Class B Medium games still a good experience length good for students who are late or played some Class C games waiting for others EXAMPLE Ticket to ride Class C Sweet and simple games can usually go for a couple of replays EXAMPLE Coup Skull This time should also include time to introduce new players to the game Complexity Being Secondary school I can not imagine many people being board game hobbyists so games so big complex games with many moving parts may not be appropriate Games should be able to be easily explained by the more frequent members of the club EXAMPLE Robo Rally Tsuro Learning element Being a maths teacher I can recognise the maths in play with most games and most games have learning elements embedded in theme so games that are good learning tools as well would be helpful In terms of learning through themeing the theme itself has to be appropriate But even better if the theme can include some light role play EXAMPLE Pandemic For learning through mechanics this can involve any subject not just maths The example i have is maths based mechanics as it gets students comfortable with using compass directions and construction EXAMPLE TREASURE ISLAND Social element Hopefully through this club I can develop student relationships across years and I think this would be best done with games that engage in social interaction imagination and variety Social interactions that can be positive like working as a team or having people word out ideas and discussion EXAMPLE Resistance Avalon Imagination and creativity are also important so games that promote that would be great EXAMPLE Dixit Variety I like games that have that one oddball element that allows the game to be more tangible whether it is special dice or restrictions on types of communication EXAMPLE Escape Curse of the temple Finally have to be games are sustainable As in if I lose a piece or the card gets bent out of shape would that make the game unplayable Would the cost to replace be negible or would I need to get a whole new copy Prefer to keep budget sensible I understand print and plays maybe a good shout I want to avoid the standard family games like Monopoly cluedo scrabble even though some like scrabble do have their place I realise that is a lot but what do you think has anyone had similar experience with a board game club What Games to add for an after school clubs collection,541,2480,3020

boardgames,In the photo there is one of the oldest games Mehen Egyptian snake game played between roughly 3100 B C and 2300 B C A typical Mehen board in the form of the coiled snake came with 3 lion pieces 3 lionesses and 6 sets of colored marbles Archeologists believe that the marbles and the lions were playing pieces and the game was for up to 6 players The rules of Mehen remain unclear but a game called The Hyena Game was found being played on a Mehen type board in Sudan in 1921 This is a game for several players Each player tries to get their main piece to the center and back whereupon their hyena piece is released The Hyena piece then also travels to the center and back but can terrorize and eat the other player s main pieces on the way The most modern reconstructions of the Mehen game have used the rules of the Hyena Game as their basis What do you think could be the real rules of Mehen Can you think of any other modern game that has something in common with Mehen p CKbBqdrLZkC igshid 1cp8aezepvffh Ancient Egyptian snake game,198,839,1036
boardgames,One of the reasons I like board games so much is that they offer up a pretty consistent stream of aha moments where something suddenly comes into focus or a certain mechanic clicks for the first time I ve been playing My City and I m so impressed by how Knizia modifies a few simple rules and it completely changes your strategy It s probably one of my favorite things in the hobby to see a robust design get tweaked in lots of different ways The Arkham Horror LCG does it better than any game I ve ever seen and with amazing thematic effect just to name one example the Essex County Express where gt you re racing to get to the front of a collapsing train lt Pandemic Legacy S1 the only one I ve played tho I have Season 0 waiting was great at this too Surprisingly the latest Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective set the Baker Street Irregulars has been bending its system in extremely clever ways gt We just played the third scenario where you have to frantically track down the file and run all over and possibly leave London lt The Exit games are all wonderful in this category too I keep wondering when they re going to run out of ideas but every game manages to surprise me with something unexpected What is your favorite thing to see pulled off in a board game What is your favorite thing a board game can accomplish,249,1076,1324
boardgames,So first things first I m not a seasoned G player by any stretch I love creative games and I love strategy Portal Board Game anyone However my friends and I all gravitate to one game every time and yes we have not yet played Ticket to Ride so our mainstay may well change Basically I love Monopoly but eventually everyone gets set in their go to strategy and changing things up gets harder to do So what if color sets weren t all next to each other and Boardwalk and North Carolina weren t always on the same side of the board I thought about doing a custom square board where every space was printed onto a removable placard that could be placed into a recess on the board so every game could play differently I e the board itself would be blank and the normal spaces would be separate pieces that could be placed onto the board in whatever order you like before starting a game I came very close to making that but after discussing it with the boys I decided to make a Monopoly board that isn t restricted to the linear predictable path of the normal square board I think the general consensus is that much of Monopoly s outcome is defined by the lack of player choice Players don t have to do much to win Strategy is sort of an afterthought So I created this prototype Xlq8mFv for a fully modular board You can have alternate routes You can have color sets on different sides of the board Things to note When playtesting it we found that having TOO many options of how to travel across the board means it s incredibly easy to not land on other players property This removes incentive to play It s incredibly easy to buy up all property very quickly in this particular configuration Defining route of travel is difficult I DID make little arrows to be placed on spaces to indicate direction of travel but did not employ them in this initial playtest For the interim we decided the rule was that you couldn t travel back onto the space you just came from but you can still travel backwards by going a different route around that space I think the original Monopoly benefits from its linearity in that it forces players to fall victim to the whims of happenstance Rules need to be established for how to properly set up the board There are 2 extra Community Chest and Chance spaces in case they are needed to bridge sections of board I created new spaces that I m just calling path spaces for now They have different footprints on them pawprints tire tracks etc and are used to connect parts of the board but do not count as spaces in that they don t use up a number on your dice roll I think more reward and penalty spaces are needed to incentivize travel I think a rule must be established that only a single entry and exit for the GO space may exist It played a bit poorly and we only did one playthrough and it was very quick and very uninteresting Gon na tweak things Some other general info I spent a combined 5 hours in photoshop making all of the spaces in Photoshop I spent a combined 5 hours cutting out the original prototype with an X acto and another 10 ish hours cutting out the printed pieces and the bits of posterboard that they re adhered to They are sat on a white corkboard poster with plexiglass on top Only the board is custom Other Pics The printed spaces FsEa4xR Some of them cut out WGBzZK5 More of them cut out UiD7ds3 Custom fully modular Monopoly board,636,2745,3380

boardgames,Just wanted to start a discussion and ask opinions So I buy games both ways I back KS campaigns and I buy games the normal way But I m curious about the effects of both on sales of the game When I buy a game one of the BIGGEST factors for me is how easy it is to get the whole game Including bonus content in a Kickstarter is dope but if I m buying a game that came out a few years ago and everyone talks about how good such and such KS exclusive was then I m probably not going to buy the game at all if I can t find that exclusive somewhere Note I m only talking about discrete mechanical elements here Any purely aesthetic stuff is nice to have but won t be a barrier for me to get into the game if I can t find it KS exclusive art or minis or whatever So what I m wondering is am I alone Like KS is a great way to get the game initially funded but do you hurt your long term sales potential by locking latecomers out of wanting your game For example Eclipse Second Dawn looks like an ideal game for me and I m happy to pay 150 for it But since I won t be able to get all that cool extra content I ll always feel like I m playing an incomplete game So I won t even go for it The same is true to a certain extent of games with a bonkers amount of expansions already in existence I almost didn t get Anachrony for that reason but they re awesome enough to have a single item that s the base game and all the expansion content In general I m happy to buy such items But if I find great games that are ten years old but are complete in the box I just find it so so easy to grab them So what are everyone s thoughts Does the way KS campaigns work create a buying frenzy in the beginning at the expense of long term sales interest Or am I in such a minority with my buying habits that I m not representative Would love to hear your views And especially if you ve been on the other side and have sales anecdotes to share Kickstarter Versus Retail Barriers to Entry FOMO and Long term Sales,412,1574,1985

boardgames,I ve been playing modern board games for some time now but I ve only recently started to consciously think about this aspect of the games I play I think playing Marrakech boardgame 29223 marrakech images repeatedly on Board Game Arena is what really opened my eyes to it Perhaps I should explain So Marrakech is a game that has a very clear random element to the game it has a roll and move mechanism where the dice dictates whether you move the common salesperson token one ⅙ two ⅓ three ⅓ or four ⅙ spaces around the board before laying a rug next to where it lands The game is about working around this random element by playing the odds you have to weigh up the likelihood of landing on your opponents rugs forcing you to pay them coins equal to the contiguous area their rugs of the colour landed on covers against the ability to further extend your own rugs cover over theirs and the better board position it will afford you with the salesperson forcing your opponent into your covered areas The game works fantastically well in a one versus one scenario and it is one of my favourite abstract two player games However in higher player counts I find the game breaks down too much changes between your turns and it becomes too difficult to make any truly meaningful moves I e the entropy of the game increases with the player count and there is nothing in the game to deal with this Now I imagine this is true of most games regardless of whether there is a clear random element or not if you have more players doing stuff in a game then naturally more stuff is going to change between your turns But many games manage this by making the turns microscopic or by putting a lot of the action on your own player board where it does not have any impact on the other players But there are a lot of games where the action takes place on a central board Food Chain Magnate and Brass for example address this by growing shrinking the play area so that the actions are spread out over a larger area reducing the entropy in the system as a fraction of the whole But there are also many games like Marrakech and Santorini that don t address this situation at all and just let the game play differently at different player counts to the point where they re practically different games So I m interested to know Are there any other games you can think of that deal with this problem not by growing the play area but in other clever ways Does it bother anyone else when a game doesn t deal with player count entropy differences Should designers be more aware of this problem and take better steps to deal with it Is it lazy to just let the games play differently at different player counts Entropy differences at different player counts,507,2220,2726

boardgames,Being a part of the BGG Facebook group and Boardgame Reddit makes it look like people from North America have a strong preference for AmeriGames and Europeans for Eurogames You might read this and think Well duh it s in the name but I was expecting it to be a bit of a mix It s 2021 by now it could have easily mingled My dive into boardgames began with an AmeriGame but by now the bigger part of my collection is Eurogames and I m Dutch Is this average preference for a type of game really embedded in the culture of the continent Or is it possible that neither groups have given the other option a fair try Or something else I know there are plenty of exceptions but it from what I see on social media it seems to lean a certain way Difference between Americans tastes in games and Europeans,153,641,793
boardgames,Since Despicable Plots expand alone release a few days ago I ve gotten back into the Villainous hype train to the point where I want to make a whole custom character for the fun The Villain Many think Te Kā is the obvious choice but not only is she really just and angry form of Te Feti but does not at all fit villain vibe like Tamatoa does Sure he s only in the movie for one song but you could argue the same for the red queen as she shows up in the original Alice in wonderland in a couple scene max so I think it s not too much of a stretch Plus there a cult following for good reason so this villain would have a lot more people open their wallets The Objective This is for sure the one I need help with My best idea is for him to have somehow collected enough items to be SHINY But right now I can only think of two in Moana Maui s Hook and of course the heart of Te Feti This kind of objective however seems quite similar to Ursula s objective to start your turn with Trident and crown in her lair I want to add so uniqueness If you have any better ideas I d love to hear them but this type of objective aligns perfectly with his goal to just be SHINY Perhaps to make it different enough from Ursula He needs to have some extra steps What s awkward is I feel like Maui and Moana should be defeated to retrieve these artifacts which is AGAIN similar to Ursula having to beat King Triton Maybe the unique part is that he has to defeat both Conditions NEW Pick an Eye Babe gallery Nr1Jdib Got a eureka moment and added this card exact copy of Lady Tremaine s Vicious Practical jokes but it s too perfect to not make lol What are your guys thoughts I m stuck in a rut right now but some extra feedback and I ll add to the post for how to concept the allies conditions items and of course fate cards Villainous custom character Tamatoa SHINY Moana villain,370,1489,1858
boardgames,Introduction So as a hobby I like to world build and for a race I have in one of my worlds I created a board game The rules lead to an extremely open ended game that seems simple I wrote a program to play the game using minimax and it can beat me fairly easily although this is typically because I blunder In having this play against itself so many strange non intuitive moves happen a lot of them make sense to me but only on a surface level Problem How can I analyze a board game of this complexity in a way that will allow me to better understand what moves should be made and why I d essentially like to generalize how the game is played to some extent and give meaning to some of the moves I have no idea where to even begin in building a thorough understanding though Part of me worries that it might just be too complex but I can follow it at times so I m not so sure Any idea s on how I might approach this problem How to Understand a Made Up Complex Board Game,196,774,969

boardgames,I purchased Patchwork for me and my girlfriend to play a couple of months ago She is not into super thinky games so it seemed like something simple she would enjoy The first two games we played we did horrible We both scored negative points However we were really enjoying the game I then sat back and wondered how I could do better at the game I decided that I would try to determine a net value for each of the three available tiles I could purchase I realized that every space moved on the time board could essentially be considered a loss of one button since each space could have been used as income instead of time to patch the quilt So if a peice would take 3 time board movements to put on my board then I would count that as 3 buttons on the net cost Next I would multiply the income value of each button by the remaining income spaces I had left to cross on the time board So if a peice had two buttons on it and I still had to cross 4 income spaces that would be 8 to the net value of buying that peice Next I would consider that each square that makes up the peice is preventing 2 points at the end of the game so I would multiply the number of squares by 2 so if a peice was 4 squares in size then that is 8 in value Next the most obvious I would factor in the cost of the actual price in buttons So if the cost is 3 buttons that is 3 buttons on the net value I would sum these values in this example we would have 3 8 8 3 10 button net value I would do this for all three peices available to me and purchase the one with the greatest net value This was incredibly tedious but it worked My score at the end of this game was around 58 This wasn t fun to play at all though The point of this post is to ask others if you ve had an issue like this where you wish the game didn t essentially boil down to simple arithmetic If so did you figure out a solution to this or do you have a list of games that you ve had this issue with that you d recommend I should avoid This is really directed at simple 2 4 player games as I prefer open information games for solo play or when playing with highly experienced players Has anyone else experienced this issue while playing perfectly open information games that you were hoping would be simple and relaxing,456,1803,2258

boardgames,I ve played New Vegas for years and in several modded play throughs I solely relied on the Service Rifle as my courier s main firearm to fit my build s meta and such Now over the span of this pandemic I ve gotten into gunsmithing as I live in a state where all that s a ok and constitutional and I ve learned quite a bit about the various AR platforms The Service Rifle is definitely based on Stoner s early concepts of the AR 15 the only difference being in game all the AR rifles have side charging uppers This was probably done to make reload animations simplified however with my new knowledge on the AR platform I find myself bothered by the fact the Service Rifle and others still retain their forward assist which is used in the animation when condition of the rifle is low However in reality a side charging upper has no need for a forward assist as its bolt is constructed in a different manner see 23 Side Charging Upper Guide Tips Maintenance and More Common Questions YouTube watch v Q3zsQkhFHfI This is probably something a vast majority of y all don t really care all that much about it s just the more I ve learned about real life firearm mechanics the less Fallout firearms make sense realistically take the 10mm pistol from Fallout 1 amp 2 as it s a semi auto revolver with a detectable magazine or the Combat Shotgun of Fallout 3 and its ejection port located like 6 8in behind the magazine TL DR FNV Service Rifle and other Fallout Firearms have unnecessary parts and non operable designs making it confusing for an amateur gunsmith who s played the Fallout series of years But that doesn t mean they aren t cool and iconic FNV Service Rifle Qualm of Mine a k a How I Found Out the Firearms of Fallout Don t Make Sense,327,1411,1737

boardgames,Bear with me here Although many might feel a strong sense of betrayal in that last talking head sequence with Jacoren for being essentially permanently exiled from the only home we ever had it s necessary to understand that he did it because he not only deeply cares about Vault 13 but also you Throughout the game we can see how Jacoren cares about your well being out in the wastes and appreciates the work you ve done to preserve the continuity of the vault A few examples gt You have no idea how sorry I am to send you back out When sending you out to the wastes again gt gt Don t downplay what you ve done You ve saved a lot of lives After you find the Water Chip gt gt You should be proud of yourself for all you ve accomplished We depended on you and you came through After ending the mutant threat However Jacoren must also wrestle with the risk of the vault residents wanting to leave As he says in his ending speech were you to re enter the vault many would see the greatness that you ve accomplished as proof that the outside world is worth exploring But we know better the world in 2161 is a world that has barely recovered from the devastation less than a century ago a world where savagery is widespread and only the most vicious survive gt Everyone will want to talk to you Every youngster will look up to you and want to emulate you And then what gt gt They ll want to leave What happens to the Vault if we lose the best of a generation What if we are the only safe place in the world You just gave us back all these lives I can t take the chance of losing them gt gt I ve made a lot of tough decisions since I took this position But none of them harder than this one You saved us but you ll kill us I m sorry You re a hero and you have to leave Ending speech It s a dangerous prospect for Jacoren but it pains him greatly to have to exile you He is eternally grateful for what you have done and could never repay you but for you to re enter the vault would only cause the destruction of what you ve accomplished Depending on the character you roleplay you may either simply leave or end up brutally murdering him which I believe is morally wrong While the canonical ending has Jacoren live we can see how opening the vault leads to its demise when in Fallout 2 we see residents massacred and ransacked by the Enclave the danger of the outside world Jacoren warned us about What do you guys think I d love to hear what your opinions are on the matter Why Jacoren was right to exile the Vault Dweller,495,2021,2515

boardgames,Story Time Last night I launched my first nuke By myself too And I was not prepared So my goal with FO76 was to finish the MSQ hit 50 and launch my own Nuke Last night I got to the I Am Become Death quest and began my quest to unleash nuclear hellfire Got my Keycard Looked up the code for this week because I m not stupid and also a bit lazy I figure that since you have to chase down the keycard and figure out the code that the actual Silo Dungeon won t be too long or hard right I load up with my PA Take my Minigun with 1 300 rounds of 5mm and my Gatling Plasma with 1 500 rounds 15 Frags And a crap ton of healing and food I feel like that is gon na be more than enough right Maybe a couple wave defenses a couple of Sentry Bots at the end and that is all right I get about 2 fifths of the way or so through the silo and I m dry Dead Man s Click on both guns Now being an intelligent veteran gamer I have some options one of which is 1 Retreat restock with a CRAPTON more ammo and come back better prepared 2 Ask for help since I have a keycard know the code and people like loot right Either one of those would be a good option right Which do you think I picked If you chose 3 Put up my dukes yell WHY DON T YOU COME CATCH THESE HANDS INSTEAD BROBOT and start punching the nearest robot in it s face Congratulations you re correct also what the hell were you doing in my house watching me last night Needless to say that didn t really produce results or any progress really Especially since I had zero Unarmed Perks Sometime after like the 12th punch I remembered I had grenades and those got me a little further but not by much GODDAMN Grenades have terrible range in FO76 At this point I gave up right Nope After the grenade attempts I realized I had picked up an Assaultron Blade somewhere along my way to the Silo I was no longer merely an ape trying to smash my way through technology I was an ape with a SHARP STICK So I did the only logical thing I did a metric FUCKLOAD of chems put on my only two Melee Perks Incisor 1 and Master Gladiator 1 and threw myself into the melee The Blade was about as effective as a rusty machete IRL but it cut body parts off surprisingly well and often Screamingly somewhat quietly though like Rambo half the time I managed to cut down even THE SENTRY BOT before I finally arrived at my salvation the Tinkerer s Bench meant to be used for the Mainframe Cores I crafted an excessive amount of Plasma Cores and blasted my way through the rest of the dungeon After finally launching the nuke nearly an hour past when I thought I was going to stop playing I emerged from the silo covered in blood mine and and soaked in oil mostly theirs Also my CAMP was a bit too close the Prime Fissure so I had wound up nuking my own CAMP to boot Which I got to watch And die in After dying to the nuke it respawned me underground INSIDE THE FISSURE I had to get out of my PA in order to die again so that I would respawn above ground Only to die from Rads immediately again Finally I spawned at the CAMP lived long enough get into my Shelter still standing and get back into my PA to join the fight and finish my time with FO76 In conclusion I just wanted you to know the story behind that Troubleshooter s Wood Right Arm you got and immediately vendor d last night FO76 I launched my first nuke about 10PM EST last night I just want you to know that was a grueling arduous task for me,688,2729,3416

boardgames,After 15 years thousands of hours of playing various titles from the Fallout series it has obviously made me ponder about what it would be like if the post great war were reality And now I seriously question my morals not necessarily in real life but if I was living in the wasteland and here is why Naturally I have an almost unhealthy obsession with the apocalypse and various survival skills This did not spawn from my love of Fallout it only made my obsession even more enjoyable it spawned from how much of a prepper and conspiracy theorist my dad was for the longest time My earliest memory of this was when my dad had my family hunker down on his ranch during the Y2K scare He seriously thought that nuclear war was going to start at 12am on January 1st 2000 and the entire world was going to go to hell He had stockpiles of survival and emergency equipment and I mean STOCKPILES of equipment seriously pallets stacked in almost every room separated into categories He had us all stay inside with all the windows boarded up for two days I love my dad but he s absolutely an insane He has many patented inventions and such in the United States so he s also kind of a genius as well As I got older he taught me how to shoot defend myself in close combat expedition survival skills foraging how to hunt with both a bow and various pistols rifles and weapons Manufacturing both melee and ballistic There were a few incidents where he got into fights or shoot outs with people because of his temper and ties with certain factions which I can t talk about publicly unfortunately Anyways aside from all of that I believe that s where I officially start to talk about why my Karma would probably be considered bad in a real life Fallout MURDER My dad contributed to my apathy and lack of certain emotional attributes a normal person would have I believe this came from him beating the hell out of me a few times and different kinds of abuse from one of his ex girlfriends at least that s what the therapists have said This is why I wouldn t have a problem being a bounty hunter and contract killer in the wasteland If I don t know them their life truly is meaningless to me If I m getting paid a good sum of bottle caps that is and I m not cheap Also I d kill anyone who gets in the way of my quests in the real wasteland or anyone who threatens or harms me Though if you re on my side or associated with me I love you and you re family I don t lack the ability to love or lack any sympathy STEALING AND PICKPOCKETING Finders keepers If you want your stuff safe and secure pay attention to it If your irresponsibility of watching your valuables gets in the way or you are not setting up proper security to protect it I ll consider it mine When I was in high school I stole from locked lockers padlocks and key locks and from peoples coats pockets in the hallway during passing periods as a game And even still I don t feel bad about it I was also obsessed with the Thieves guild from The Elder Scrolls SLAVERY In real life I do not condone or support any type of slavery or unwanted physical acts whatsoever I have actually stopped a few situations from happening to friends of mine IRL that could have gone horribly wrong In the wasteland though slavery is technically not uncommon or illegal There are no laws besides in certain locations controlled by certain factions Therefore I would not try and stop anyone from owning slaves or free any slaves unless under certain circumstances and that alone would consider me either Neutral or Bad Karma on that subject FACTIONS In real life nobody controls me or tells me what to do Nobody I don t support our current government or any type of enforcement because socially we are already in this alone and at a free for all In the wasteland don t try to annex me or enslave me or even force me to join anything That WILL NOT go over well to you unless there are IMMENSE benefits RAIDING Now I ll never raid a house that has a family with children or the house is entirely women I have so much respect for women but I will raid a house of capable and non sickly men Murder of innocents is bad karma naturally CANNIBALISM I don t see a problem with eating your neighbor who had a negative impact on you a rando who raided or caused you harm or one of your group who passed away The wasteland s food supply is scarce by the time New Vegas and Fallout 4 came around there is even a risk of famine I say get all the food you can even if it s name was Bob at some point AND FINALLY SPEECH If it benefits me even if it possibly negatively impacts someone in the wasteland I will use my charisma and natural wordplay IRL speech skill to manipulate them As long as I m making caps or making something happen BO LE CAPS Y ALL WHOOP WHOOP So in conclusion I would probably be close to something as the Wasteland s Satan Lol Or maybe you guys think I deserve a lighter Karma sentence I would have the WORST KARMA if Fallout was real

boardgames,Hey all I had a pretty good shower thought the other day What if the next fallout game took place in the Midwest and what if the Enclave were a faction Basically this midwestern Enclave would be drastically different than the Enclave from previous games This Enclave is the remnants of the Enclave that were defeated in the previous games who migrated east after their defeat This Enclave had to survive by trading with the local survivors and after a decade the Enclave remnants became a formidable force once again but the years of trade and mutual assistance between the survivors has caused a rift between the Enclave remnants and caused two major factions to arise OWB fallout mod influence incoming The Purists and the insert other faction name here these two factions are separated along the lines of how to treat the survivors The purists wish to remain true to the old Enclave ways and purge anything mutated While the other faction still wants to remove radiation they wish to find a non lethal way of doing so they also wish to cleanse the previous sins the Enclave has committed The player character gets to decide which faction wins the civil war that ensues Regardless of what faction you choose you can get optional settlement missions which will either purge restore based on the faction you chose the map Eventually if you do enough of these missions you can completely remove radiation from the map basically turning this fallout game into DayZ looking world As to not completely remove the challenge of the irradiated creatures the NPC s become much more difficult and a few of the irradiated creatures survive the cleansing which only make them much stronger The player character is also able to have a number of Enclave soldiers at his side of which they are the commander of Of course this is not the only faction you can side with this is just one of many that would be in this fallout game so you could still keep the irradiated world Anyway these are just my shower thoughts regarding fallout thanks for reading Idea for next fallout game regarding the Enclave,365,1721,2085
boardgames,at the end it would pan to a companion you romanced with a biological or adopted child and it s basically like the entire game up to the end was a story to your child and if you don t have a romanced companion it could be piper making a news report different endings for each faction ex railroad the railroad would probably still break into the institute but what they d do is help plan a mass escape for every synth in the institute wiping out most of the institute Minutemen they would break into the institute and the player would go into Fathers room and get the chance to do a red speech check to merge the institute and the minutemen because Preston might see it as a great opportunity for a thriving settlement and if the speech check is passed then the institute would have peace with the commonwealth Institute and Brotherhood s quests are the same i don t really like the quests I came up with but yeah being able to go to doctor Amari s and see pre war memories ways fallout 4 more could be more interesting,194,825,1018

boardgames,The Divide happened before the First Battle of Hoover Dam when Joshua Graham was head Legate After Lanius took his place Lanius armor is unique to him only Caesar stating it was hand forged and designed specifically for him So it makes no sense the marked men made a Lanius mask As for the Legion in the Divide at all it s highly unlikely the Legion went that far east Especially with how they would have had to get there The Divide s Faux Lanius Masks Doesn t Make Sense nor Does the Legion being There,96,408,503
boardgames,The Great War escalated between the two forces due to a lack of ressources especially oil if I recall correctly the intro to Fallout 2 correctly Alaska being a important source of oil for the USA it is understandable that China invaded this territory at the time Now I presuppose that China and the USA had the same advancement in technology especially demonstrated by the chinese stealth armor for instance or the nuclear submarines both used by the nations If they have the same technological level why would they both need oil The cars are powered by nuclear energy the planes are powered by nuclear energy the boats are powered by nuclear energy the guns are powered by nuclear energy the power armors are powered by nuclear energy the robots are powered by nuclear energy everything is powered by nuclear energy Why starting a nuclear holocaust for oil if you don t even use it at this point Maybe for plastic but I doubt it is something very much used in the fallout universe being highly influenced by the 50s where plastic in products was not common like now They had many alternatives to create energy too like Helios One in Fallout NV or simply Hoover Dam hydraulic energy could have been expended upon The had enough nuclear materials to create a nuclear amarda capable of wiping humanity but still they are lacking oil and for some weird reason oil is important in a universe where it is useless now Maybe I m missing something here but now I favor the idea that the true cause of the Great War was mostly Vault Tec idk They didn t need oil in the first place everything is powered by nuclear energy why bother going to war for that,297,1348,1644

boardgames,Has anybody ever noticed that Fallout 4 and the film featuring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost The World s End have many similarities story wise Let me explain The primary antagonistic threat in The World s End is a network that has been replacing people in the crew s home town with blanks or synthetic humans This is to apparently neutralise threats across the galaxy and intertwine the planets together under one system This is very similar to the Institutes replacement of humans across the wasteland with synths Their goal is very similar as well being to redefine humanity with their scientific advancements Additionally their methods of integrating into society is the exact same as the network in The World s End They slowly replace a small amount of people to achieve their goal But finally both of the endings are the same In one of the Fallout 4 Endings the Institute is rigged to explode This is the exact same as the ending to The World s End being the network self destructing after the protagonist Garry King convinces it to fuck off I don t know I might be overthinking this but I thought it was cool Fallout 4 The World s End,205,932,1136

boardgames,It feels like talking about NV many people completely discourage critical thinking But they are ready to scold Bethesda for every little thing Game is praised for its excellent storyline full completely ignoring meaning itself plot amp x200B Main quest is Game begins with a badly drawn video as if it were a Fallout 2 video opening Wake up with amnesia and instead of leaving dangerous zone for some reason get caught up in maelstrom of events in order to deal with your killer about whom you do not remember anything and do not know in order to do your quest but still nowhere do not leave and suddenly start helping or hindering people who you also completely do not care about And then we arrange a revolution for one of parties And in DLC we are doing complete madness in styles of best action movies different genres Game literally leads in hand from point to point across a huge empty boring world to round islands of events And so from island to island Research is almost always of no use at all leading to dead end And in DLC you can also find out that you are playing as another Revan chosen from the prophecy of Mary Sue creator and destroyer of humanity but about whom few people know And who somehow still works as a courier after what did And in stupidity plot twist was shot as a completely ordinary person no skill or position to be resurrected and again to do people good What kind of deus ex macina in a postman s cap is that Moreover if it were not for Obsidian name people would have shouted that this plot is banal to point of impossibility amp x200B Plots about a god who has lost his memory became mortal who gets into other people s affairs is an Obsidian classic But for some incredible reason that s what many players love for And always this standard chosen one it s a perfectly average european boi Obsidian repeats over and over again this scheme from isometric games inserting them into everything that they are given for outsourcing And for some reason people like it And each time they aggressively defend this completely ignoring all disadvantages To change this terrible scheme it was enough to make main character an ordinary traveler who came to Vegas to earn money and luck And not make mega pretentious NCR anther game symbol Then character is really free to do what he wants has moral principles that depend on player choice and player himself decides what motives character has But it is known for sure that character is simply doing his job to get money Then character will really have motivation there will be an explanation of what is doing here and why character has little skills And all actions can be explained by it is just work and player self invents motivation for character Why do people like NV plot,499,2254,2752

boardgames,I ve been reading into the FO lore and found something which in a weird way fascinates me As we all know according to lore after the US spotted Chinese submarines off of their coasts nuclear missile launches were detected at 09 13 EST and confirmed by NORAD at 09 17 EST As a response to that at 09 26 EST the US government presumably the president ordered a retaliatory strike according to the so called scenario MX CN91 At 09 42 EST nuclear detonations in Pennsylvania and New York were confirmed All of this information is accessible at the Switchboard terminal in Fallout 4 Now how realistic is that scenario MX CN91 As far as I know which isn t much there are no further informations or details about this scenario So how plausible is it that the US government or any government for that matter would after realizing that the enemy launched nukes decide to basically take the rest of the world down with them The thought process well we re dead but we re gon na fire our nukes anyway just to make sure that if we don t survive no one does is in a weird way very interesting to me Because at that point when the Chinese missile launches were confirmed they had to be aware that they were going to die right amp x200B Thoughts How realistic is scenario MX CN91,237,1027,1263

boardgames,So in my opinion you shoudn t side with the NCR or the Legion in the Battle of Hoover Dam because the leadership of both sides are willing to steamrole over the people of the Mojave just to satisfy the imperialistic ambitions and frankly most of the people that you deal with in the NCR Moore Kimball Oliver and the Legion Caesar are rather condescending and rude That is why I have boiled it down to two options House and Yes Man But I am having a hard time trying to decide which is best for the people of the Mojave So who do you think which path is the best option for the Mojave But before you do let me just give you an analysis on the pros and cons of both options So with House you got a guy who seems like a much nicer boss compared to Kimball and Caesar He s not exactly good but he s not exactly bad either And while there are those like Arcade who claims that House is a tyrant towards the people of New Vegas there is not much evidence that he has taken any actions to oppress anybody other than his irrational hatred of mutants and ghouls Of course on the flip side with the exception of bringing clean water electricity and public order to the denizens of the strip he hasn t really done anything to improve the lot of the people of Freeside Westside and North Vegas or any of the other settlements in the Mojave In fact he seems more interested in using the resources of Vegas and the Mojave to complete his grand plan of space colonization And while it sounds like a noble goal given the state of the world and all wouldn t it be better to invest those resources in creating more practical technologies like G E C K s solar collectors and water purifiers and instead of some vanity project All in all House is definitely the lesser of two evils when compared to the NCR and the Legion but I m not sure his vision is the one the Mojave needs right now Then there is the other option Yes Man So basically as far as I know Yes Man doesn t really have any long term goals for Vegas or the Mojave and in all honesty the Wild Card path isn t all that different from the House path it just gives you more freedom in how you deal with all the various factions Personally I m leaning towards this path because I believe the Wild Card path may ultimately lead towards the creation of a government that is focused on bettering the lives of the people of the Mojave Granted some of General Oliver s complaints are valid and a lot of the people who live in the Mojave aren t really that interested in creating infrastructure and businesses let alone nation building But I still believe that it is possible to turn the Mojave into a nation that can rival the NCR and the Legion so long as you have the resources Big MT and the Sierra Madre good trade agreements NCR Sorrows Dead Horses Great Khans and the right leadership good neutral karma charismatic courier Marcus the King Pearl Julie Farkas The only thing that worries me is Yes Man at the end of the game he says that he s going to given himself upgrades that will make him more assertive but I m not sure whether that s a good thing Their is literally no way of telling whether or not these upgrades will make be better just as bad or worse than the leaders of the three major factions And if they do turn him rogue he might try to take over Vegas with the upgraded Securitron army so he can impose he own dictatorship or autocracy But other than that this does seem like the best option to go for unless I am missing something else So now that I have made my arguments please feel free to comment on why you think House or Yes Man is the best choice for the people of the Mojave Which Fallout NV ending is the best for the people of the Mojave and why Yes Man or House,724,3007,3730

Fallout,I haven t completed Fallout 1 but I do know a lot about the Master and the mutants He wanted physically superior humanoids but what about intelligence It obviously took a hit for most mutants but wouldn t the Master have wanted intelligent mutants at least to human level Because he wants them to thrive and they can t do that on purely strength alone Did the Master want intelligent super mutants,72,326,397

Fallout,Out of the three characters in fallout 3 nv and 4 who would win in a fight with guns personally I think sole survivor as he had military experience before the was and line wanderer is out pretty much as he spent most of his life in a vault but I m not sure if the courier could beat the sole survivor Lone wanderer vs the courier vs sole survivor,70,277,346

Fallout,Here s my pitch The game would take place in colorado near the rockies It would focus on the NCR vs BOS for control of the cheyenne mountain complex which is in the hands of the last members of the enclave The setting would be mountainous and snowy with some grassland dessert as you go off the mountains The major factions would the previously mentioned NCR BOS Enclave and the masters army The enclave would seal themselves inside the complex and the eastern BOS and NCR would come to Colorado The masters army would be leaderless but in charge of most of the area As for the player character You would be from vault 200 the experiment would be the overseer lead a jonestownesk cult And half the dwellers have been over the years indoctrinated into the cult A civil war breaks out in the vault and you are exiled The gameplay would be that of FO4 with the story aspects of NV The Rockstone commonwealth would span over the mountains and the Denver colorado springs area The smaller factions would be the settlement a fledgeling colony where the railroad sends liberated synths The creeks the survivors of the gold mining operation in that area who would live underground mostly And the cult that the vault was lead by What do you all think What I d like to see in fallout 5,233,1043,1275
Fallout,In my play through I m going with yes man and I m wondering if I should get both the enclave and the brotherhood or blow the brotherhood up For a little context my character I m rp as was a former ncr soldier and after his service he gained a distaste for the ncr and after his service he wandered the wastes and ended up being a Courier and his father was a distinguishe d ncr soldier in the war against the enclave Sorry im writing this on my phone Should I side with both the enclave and the brotherhood,101,406,506

Fallout,Quick note I was inspired to do a concept like this by this post ments mf6p7g fallout_new_mexico_an_unofficial_sequel_of utm_source share amp utm_medium ios_app amp utm_name iossmf Fallout New Orleans Set 30 years after the events of Fallout 4 Fallout New Orleans FNO is a sequel to Fallout 4 It s stories are connected in some ways It is May 1st 2318 You play as the main protagonist Thomas Breaux Elizabeth Hebert The game starts on October 23rd 2077 You are riding a motorcycle in Gulfport Mississippi when the game begins The radio cuts out and you get switched to another station Alert Alert This is not a drill Bombs have been reported by affiliate stations in Los Angeles Boston Miami and New York I repeat this is not a drill Any Vault Tec personnel have been ordered to their respective vaults All members of any vault are being requested to head to your designated vault with haste It is only a matter of time until Then the bomb drops You look around confused as to why the radio stopped but then you look up to a gigantic mushroom cloud over New Orleans You try to drive away but eventually have to bail behind a building You pull out your phone to the contacts Thomas Elizabeth is the contact Depends on who you chose You drop the phone as you fell the heat then the radiation Your character drops to the floor blanking out You switch to the character you actually chose 5 MINUTES EARLIER This is a Vault Tec important notice It seems that there have been bombs dropped on multiple United States cities Please begin to head to your designated vault now Thank you for choosing Vault Tec You pick up your child Noah and grab a suitcase from the table Damnit Julie was right Let s go Noah Dad will meet us there You head to the vault and then as you eventually get to the loading bay you hear a loud bang and turn around You see a ginormous mushroom cloud looming over New Orleans You and Noah are quickly brought underground as the heat wave begins to fly over You play through a few years of vault life obviously sped up You are in Vault 504 You play through Noah s birthday a few Vault events etc Eventually in the year 2089 the vault runs out of food Everyone is ordered to their designated cyro pods The player and Noah are then frozen for over 200 years until they are unfrozen in 2318 CONNECTION TO FALLOUT 4 Vault Tec has since abandoned the vault but all vault dwellers are alive The player and other characters wander about for a while until they see Nate wiki Nate Nate after the events of Fallout 4 set out to restore some normalcy to the wastelands You learn that Nate has traveled from Boston and has helped build up cities and settlements all throughout the East Coast Nate came across the vault sealed up and had wondered if there was anyone stuck inside there after having memories of Overseer Barstow The vault dwellers thank Nate and then before he goes you talk to him and ask him if he needs any help I m actually heading to New Orleans right now It would be great if I could have some help who knows the local areas You then join Nate on a trip to New Orleans Once in New Orleans Nate informs you that he s planning on staying there for a while He says if you ever need him you can contact him on a spare pipboy that he hands you MAIN STORY In Fallout 5 the main storyline is one that revolves around New Orleans After finding yourself in New Orleans you head to the Superdome When you arrive you meet a group of members of a faction named Brotherhood of the Swamp After you arrive you end up getting asked if you d like to join them They give you an initiation quest This Smells Fishy This the first full quest of the game You are tasked with clearing out a couple of shacks infested with Crawgators Radfish and Radflys along with Mutant Crawfish You have to clear out the shack in the search of a missing faction member Jean Franco Baptiste Bernard Once clearing it out you find the corpse of a Brotherhood member He has a holo tape that says that they retreated into the shack and that the others made it into the bunker His corpse has a key on it for the bunker Once you make it in you find a crazed Jean He hasn t been seen in over 30 days He is malnutritioned and on the brink of insanity You bring him back to where the Brotherhood told you to meet them at Audubon Zoo Once there you come across their main base of operations in New Orleans They have multiple Eventually later in the story you ll meet The Protectors of the Land They are a faction dedicated to preserving and redeveloping land in the swamp You ll meet a few more factions and the main story will have you working for different factions along with Nate in order to find out information about a secret organization that plans to use an undetonated nuke on a Chinese Submarine in order to take out the few remaining factions of the wasteland The end of the story is when you breach the submarine and are able to save the city but then you have to divert it to one of the main factions headquarters forever deleting them from the game After this quest two factions will have died There is also an option to side with the secret organization and help build additional nukes in order to eliminate all of the factions in the New Orleans area FACTIONS OF THE PELICAN STATE Link to theory map Black area is barren wasteland and completely unlivable a fRaf8Rj Brotherhood of the Swamp The Brotherhood of the Swamp is a militaristic faction that is based in the city of Houma Louisiana They were formed more than 150 years ago by Dean Francis Ever since they have used their impressive numbers in both men and equipment to keep peace and order in the Pelican State but especially in New Orleans Their primary region of control is the marsh and swamp in and around Houma HQ is in Houma Protectors of the Land The Protectors of the Land were created as a direct counter to the Brotherhood They are in a strong alliance with The Floridian Confederation and Cajun Navy These three have formed the Anti Brotherhood Pact They control Easternmost areas of the map HQ is in Belle Chasse The Establishment The Establishment controls most of what was Metropolitan New Orleans plus some It is one of the bigger and the most powerful faction It is also known as the Secret Organization It is a highly classified faction and it is the most civilized of the lots Although they may be seen as the most dangerous they also commonly give the most humanitarian options for anybody under their rule This faction will give the player lots of moral dilemmas You ll find out towards the end of the story however that a little bit of Voodoo and magic might be affecting how everything seems to you and maybe everyone else is right in their concerns of the Establishment HQ is in the Superdome The Floridian Confederation The Floridian Confederation is the second strongest faction but also the biggest They have control over all of Florida and the Gulf Coast up to Louisiana They are not as militaristically advanced as the Establishment however HQ is in Miami Cajun Navy The Cajun Navy is a naval based faction They are militaristically inferior to their neighbors but are in the Anti Brotherhood Pact and have a superior navy They are also very wild they do not live by many morals HQ is in Port Sulphur The Pelican Confederation The Pelican Confederation is a faction that had merged out of four minor factions Together they rose against the Brotherhood in 2200 and broke through to Houma making them accept a peace treaty Tensions have since risen again HQ is in Morgan City Children of the Magnolia This faction is a cultist religious group that believes that Hades Greek God of the Underworld had sent the bombs This faction is ruled by their immortal leader Zoro Garacula He is thirteen years old in human age but is over 3 000 years old according to the cult legend They have been at constant war with every surrounding faction for 25 years HQ is in Thibodaux Lafayette Free Riders The Lafayette Free Riders are a group of military men that were frozen in their vault for 200 years Now they find themselves fighting to save the rest of the state from the red rule as they call it They are very unaware of the current conditions of the world HQ is in Lafayette Baton Rouge 9th Division BR 9th Division is a faction of Supermutants and other radiated creatures Your goal in the story will be to save Baton Rouge and the surrounding areas After doing so you will assign rulers to each part of the faction land HQ is in Baton Rouge NEW CREATURES ENEMIES GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS Radfly A mutated and radiated mosquito Found everywhere Gatorcraw different A radiated alligator that crawls on the ground and snaps at you Primarily found in swampy areas Radfish Radiated fish Found in waterways Mutant Crawfish Mutated crawfish very large Found everywhere Witches Voodoo driven witches that are found anywhere Voodoo Ghouls Possessed Ghouls that listen to the head Witches Found anywhere Mutant Spiders Radiated spiders found everywhere Possessed Raider A raider possessed by the power of Voodoo magic Found in the Southern factions Voodoo Magic A magical group of witches led by Marie Laveau all lurk around the city and surrounding areas using witchcraft voodoo and other practices in attempts to affect and control how life in the Pelican State goes CONCLUSION Fallout New Orleans would be a very cultural based game getting a lot of inspiration from New Orleans Cajun and Voodoo culture The story would be connected to Fallout 4 through Nate This is all a theory of course and Bethesda likely already have started on the next Fallout games details Plus we likely won t have Fallout 5 for another 5 years Let me know what you think Fallout New Orleans

Fallout,I don t have a lot of specific details about some upcoming reveals especially things after this year or Elder Scrolls VI but I know enough from this year to share Fallout 4 Special Edition early November 2021 Will be on Xbox Game Pass Fallout 4 The Stars Above DLC included in Special Edition not available for the original release Will take players to the moon as well as a space station above Fallout 4 s Commonwealth Bigger than Far Harbor and will tie into Fallout 76 s Tales from the Stars update and to celebrate Starfield s release No official Fallout 3 or New Vegas remasters due to the success of certain mod teams in the Fallout communities as well as Bethesda not wanting to dismiss the efforts of fan creators The next Fallout will NOT be made by Bethesda s main studio and is in pre production limbo until after a certain studio finishes their current efforts Will be using the same version of the engine as Fallout 4 Special Edition As such Bethesda is working entirely on Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI and no new titles until both are complete in order to maintain quality control Yes they re serious about that sort of thing this time This will amount to longer development times and thus a farther out release schedule for the latter at least because Starfield is set to release this year Microsoft purchase has caused Bethesda to readjust their stance on partnering with certain development studios Take that as you will I will not be updating this information at a later date or posting about it again in the future Anything regarding the information posted here that doesn t come from this account is unrelated and or not me so be warned if similar information comes forward it s most likely piggybacking and not truthful For security I will not divulge how I know this information so feel free to write this off until official announcements during the summer Fallout Update Starfield Bethesda News,340,1580,1919
Fallout,Having only played fallout 4 fully through once What is the ideals of the brotherhood Where are they based in Why would they come to the commonwealth just because they want to destroy the institute what direct effects was the institute causing on the brotherhood Help lol What is the Brotherhood of Steel,53,252,304
Fallout,As the title says Boone s and Ed e s weapons disappeared when I exited Gomorrah I only found this out after exiting Gomorrah but Im sure that the weapons disappeared a long time ago I installed YUP and NVAC in hopes of stopping this glitch but Im not experienced in modding this is my first time modding anything Will these mods actually stop these glitches from happening again Thanks Companions weapons disappeared when exiting Casinos,76,362,437
Fallout,And in my opinion that s settlers with names personalities and their own unique quests Sure there are your companions that you can send to any settlement you want but that doesn t really count imo because I m talking about settlers And besides acquiring the Vault Tec salesman who doesn t really do anything himself accept be another settler he s not all that special And I feel like this is a hugely messed opportunity to make the settlement system actually something special One of favorite game franchises of the ps2 generation was the Dark Cloud series and it sort of had a build your own town component to it too And while it may not be in depth it did have very unique characters who all distinctly wanted things that only you could provide like where they wanted to live next to or what they wanted added to their house Imagine how fun it could have been if you acquired someone who really wanted to start their own radio station So they d ask you to build them a place that could be their studio with a functioning radio tower Then after you finish building him his radio station you could tune to it during the game at any time and listen to him That would have been awesome Or perhaps someone whose backstory was that their lest home was attacked and destroyed by raiders and that he d never feel safe until there was a wall and turrets surrounding his house Now you could just build a wall and turrets around his house only or you could put it around the whole settlement and that would be equally as valid Then also perhaps the radio man that you built a radio station for will comment on the new defenses while you go out an adventure Or maybe you have someone who likes to fish so they request that wherever you put their house it would be next to the river And as a consequence of fulfilling their request you ll get more fish and fish related foods for sale in your general store that also generates a little more money for your settlement Things like that would have made the settlement system so much more memorable in my opinion Because the way it is only feel like it only matters as far as you really want to invest in making it look aesthetically good because the settlers don t have any names and they only give you generic radiant quests at random from time to time that are not memorable You only care about the people as far as the stats are involved I ll be honest though I don t hate the concept of a settlement building in Fallout or Elder Scrolls I just dislike how it s been implemented Like Bethesda knew that everyone might not care for it so they made it that you could ignore it entirely if you wanted to But the consequence of that is that it doesn t feel all that important obviously Also and this pretty peeves me off but you can only floors and ceilings and stuff down flatly and Fallout almost never has any flat terrain So it often looks like your buildings are floating a little off the ground and that sucks What I feel Fallout 4 s settlement system lacked,565,2435,2999
Fallout,The Atmosphere With both Beta Fallout 76 and the current version the atmosphere was always on point The world truly felt as though it was empty Everyone was dead but the world still felt full of life with all of the little tidbits scattered around the map Another thing I think it did well was its portrayal of Pre War American life It portrays it like Fallout 4 should have riddled with civil strife the threat of automation stealing your job constantly looming and the overall corruption in Appalachia and the United States It really sells this with stuff like events where you suppress protestors and audio logs found throughout the map Otis Pike s Story really shows this The Lore I love and hate what Fallout 76 does with lore I love the backstory for the Raiders but I hate the fact that Roger Maxson moved through Appalachia despite earlier lore saying otherwise But I generally love what it does with both the Raiders and the Enclave Rose is one of my favorite characters in any Fallout game Modus is also really cool and the connections with him and Henry Eden really make sense The World The world and graphics of Fallout 76 is absolutely stunning The world feels real and alive There are so many nooks and crannies to explore and discover The story is told through notes and holotapes which I think really fits the overall theme Overall Fallout 76 is a very flawed game but its definitely getting better and is totally worth a second chance What Fallout 76 Did Right,265,1213,1477
Fallout,I was chilling in my red rocket settlement when supermutants decide to show up during the fight i shot a supermutant with a double barrel shotgun but i couldent reload it now when i shoot weapons i cant reload them manually and they dont reload automaticly when you try shooting with an empty mag i can only reload in 3rd person and when i un equip and re equip the weapon im my pip boy is this a known fixable bug also i was playing with mods but even with mods disabled i cant reload Cant Reload my Guns in Fallout 4 PS4,103,420,522
Fallout,Fallout 4 made a lot of controversial changes like the alterations to it s dialogue system he introduction of settlement building and the meter based critical hit mechanic Whilst these decisions all have boy supporters and opponents there is one criticism I see repeatedly about its main story that I just don t think is fair Specifically the idea that it s too linear when compared to previous entries in the franchise Let s consider the first game s main story The Vault Dweller must find the water chip there is only one in one location and bring it back to vault 13 Then he or she must resolve the mutant issue eventually leading to the Master s Cathedral where the Dweller can kill the Master convince the Master to commit suicide or join the Unity The branching options here are in the ability to skip clues sequence breaking through out of character knowledge and the fact that additional dialogue options including the aforementioned suicide can be accessed if the Dweller has explored optional areas enough Then there s Fallout 2 which curiously enough has a main plot which becomes branchier in the middle and a lot more linear again towards the end Whilst interactions with various factions can give different options for reaching the Enclave Oil Rig the Chosen One must kill the President and the head of the Secret Service resulting in the base being destroyed Fallout 3 does something similar fitting with its alpha and omega theme There are several ways to acquire clues skip large portions of the plot and enter Little Lamplight Once the GECK is acquired however the plot becomes fairly straightforward with a final major choice at the end Fallout New Vegas has a quite linear first act up to entering the Strip with several options after that point From that point almost all the other elements of the game are skippable depending on faction choice with Yes Man being able to ignore almost all other factions and sidequests whilst the NCR can bypass the Platinum Chip altogether No matter what though the story will always end on Hoover Dam fighting across either east to west or west to east Fallout 4 by contrast has arguably three different endings each with radically different quest structures One can destroy the Institute with the aid of another faction The Nuclear Option one choice with three variations Alternatively one can side WITH the Institute and destroy the Brotherhood of Steel by overriding their superweapon Airship Down As a final option one can play the factions against one another having the Railroad destroy the Brotherhood Rocket s Red Glare then wiping the Railroad leadership out on behalf of the Institute the Sole Survivor can explicitly tell Father that he or she simply used the Railroad until they were no longer useful avoiding both the Nuclear Option AND Airship Down Furthermore the player is given considerable freedom in how to handle the factions The Railroad can be eliminated upon first contact if the player wishes it permanently closing off that faction The Brotherhood and the Institute can t be destroyed as easily but they can be permanently made enemies of the first time the Sole Survivor meets Danse and Father The Brotherhood questline has an interesting variation if Madison Li can not be recruited As an especially interesting twist the faction which can wipe out two of the others and go on to be he most powerful in the game is completely optional The entire Minuteman questline and all of its NPCs can be avoided if the player chooses The nonlinearity starts earlier than people tend to remember too There are a myriad of ways to be directed towards Nick Valentine including an option for players who travel to Goodneighbour first Alternatively it can be sequence broken by heading straight to Park Street station There is a case to be made for Fallout 4 s main story being the least linear out of the whole franchise,668,3222,3889
Fallout,I always found Fallout 3 s ending slides to be kind of dumb when you think about it since they always seem to act like the Lone Wanderer was a coward for letting Sarah be the one to turn on Like sure our dad made the thing and we want to make sure his legacy is realized but Sarah is the one who gave the speeches and led the charge to Purity so it would make sense that she is the one to turn the damn thing on And what makes even less sense is that 3 of your companions who are immune to radiation refuse to turn on the purifier even though they can survive it Like yeah I get they will if Broken Steel is installed but if you aren t playing the dlc then the arguments for them not going in make no sense Besides that Fallout games are supposed to be more open ended in terms of morality so making it seem like you are a horrible person for choosing something feels off Fallout 3 s ending was stupid,183,719,901
Fallout,So I accidentally reset my game in Fallout 4 and I was extremely dissapointed because I finally got to Diamond City Anyway that is beside the point So I am heading to the vault as part of the before nuke scene and I was wondering as soon as you leave the vault what can I do after I collect Dogmeat Can you change Dogmeat s name I decide to usually go straight to Concord but is there anything better to do before I leave Sanctuary I hope that someone can help me I need this but if you don t have the answer I am fine with that Thank you Fallout 4 Question,113,445,557

Fallout,Granted I probably have some bias because 4 was my first game of the series but I will try and put that aside The weapon and armor customization is incredible the characters mostly feel real although I do wish you could interact with raiders without fighting The map design is cool the creatures are menacing and at least to me the story is ok The only real aspect I dislike is settlement building which I actively avoid Leave your opinions and I will look at them all Why do people hate Fallout 4,93,405,497

Fallout,I got the game at launch so I ve experienced the worst of it the bugs the controversies the scandals but I m glad I gave the game another chance it s really came a long way When Wastelanders was released it brought human NPCs and a main story that is in my opinion better than Fallout 4 The community around the game is also great and really friendly to new players You should give Fallout 76 a second chance,80,329,408

Fallout,Mine is Vault 4 Construction began in 2062 and is one of the first few Vaults and there isn t a real completion date This Vault s Experiment was unique in that it was closed indefinitely and the Vault grew in a sense Every so often a section of wall would open revealing more Rooms Clinics Hallways Reactors etc None of the Dwellers would ever see this happening and they were meant to believe the Vault was always like that Meanwhile another False Wall Door would seal the Hallway to the Entrance making any Dweller trying to find it believe they were lost Every now and again the Vault will continue to grow and despite the efforts of the Dwellers they d never see it coming When the Bombs dropped in 2077 the Construction Robots were still building the Vault with their Supervisor neglecting to shut them off Thanks to this for the next several decades they kept going as if nothing had happened When they ran out of materials for the Vault they dismantled the Heavy Machinery the Workers had left behind and used those for the walls When that ran out they used some of the broken Robots for the walls Eventually they just kept digging and digging Deeper and further Vault 4 s construction never completed Sometimes they would breach into another Vault that had failed and dismantled the Vault to continue work on Vault 4 What are some of your ideas for a Vault,248,1117,1364

Fallout,My theory is that prior to his FEV exposure Harold had the ghoul gene or whatever biologically allows people to turn into ghouls in the fallout universe When he got exposed to the FEV virus the high amount of radiation combined with the FEV turned into a Ghoul super mutant a super mutant without any of the muscle not intelligence gain loss from the FEV virus but exposed enough to change him That s why he has green skin yet still looks like a ghoul despite of that THEORY Harold from Fallout 1 3 might indeed be a ghoul but not as you might expect,105,446,550

Fallout,Fallout mods are a great thing Modding as a whole are great for Bethesda s games And many have made or are making whole games in mods such as Fallout 2 having fanmade game sized mods Fallout 3 in Fallout 4 New Vegas in Fallout 4 and even The Frontier And one thing I personally would like to make is a completely new game using either Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 4 And basically what I m asking here is thoughts on the basic premise just a basic premise so it isn t exactly fleshed out and possibly things some may want expect Basically you come from a raider gang as second in command or just highly trusted and are sent out to scout new land as the gang your with is looking to expand You scout the new area find any settlements and try to get them on your side or make them not a risk These settlements will have differing ways to interact with them slavery diplomacy political etc Some settlements will be immune to one method or harder to do a method some are rivals and you have to choose which would be better for your gang stuff like that Again this is just a basic premise There hopefully would be more that I hope to add expand if my mod ever comes into an actual idea Just an Interesting Idea for the Future,237,983,1219

Fallout,I have been wanting to replay this game ever since I was a teenager Unfortunately bethesda doesn t like to remaster or port their older games so for a while I had no options Problem 1 No PC never owned one I plan on buying one eventually for mods but it seems pretty intimidating since I don t know anything about modding on computers Problem 2 I only have a PS4 and a Switch As far as I m aware new vegas was never released on ps4 or the switch Problem 3 PSnow actually has FNV so I paid the 60 for the membership What I didn t know is that PSnow doesn t include the dlc to many of the games AND the game looks absolutely terrible because it s a streaming service Like it looks really bad Problem 4 Xbox game pass which I have on my phone just released all the bethesda games on game pass mobile EXCEPT FNV I was devastated Looking online for a used Xbox seemed to be my only solution but unfortunately I m in a small town and the video game scene is pretty weak Facebook marketplace just had broken ones or people were asking 300 for a xbox 360 Finally after months of waiting I call my local game store and they just got a 360 in the store and they were testing it They wanted 100 bucks for it Seemed to be a slim model 4gb with a 250gb add on Decent deal Even comes with a controller So I buy it and a copy of FNV and Fallout 3 Got home plugged the console in and after 2 hours of trying to remember emails and passwords I finally remember my old Xbox gamer tag from years ago Rip my friends list so sad After the account is set up Skyrim booted up They left a copy in the 360 for me I think it was a joke lmao I then proceed to buy all the FNV DLC on the old 360 gamestore annnnd I m ready Ready to relive one of the greatest games of all time I press start on the game and update it BOOM disc doesn t work I go to the game store and get another copy Doesn t work 3rd times the charm right I go back to the game store slightly irritated and ask for another copy Go home The game doesn t work Skyrim works fallout3 works But not new vegas Something is fishy I then proceed to delete the initial update for FNV and then reinstall it Will it work Will I be forever cursed to not play this wonderful game To my surprise deleting that update worked I am now level 19 and I haven t even step foot on the strip yet and it s as wonderful as I remembered Reddit mobile Please excuse the typos and format Let me tell you about my quest to play Fallout New Vegas,501,1956,2456
Fallout,Hello all This was my last resort but I am at my wits end because I have tried almost all solutions to fix this I am making a post about this because the most recent posts I could find were from 3 years ago I have tried playing in windowed mode running as administrator running in compatibility mode for windows xp 3 and I have also tried changing the imo files to make the game use 2 cores instead of one which is supposed to help fix the issue Nothing has worked and I am still experiencing random freezes which can be between 5 mins to 20 mins of gameplay I hope that someone here can recommend a method I don t know about or maybe a mod of some sort to fix it Also idk if this is relevant but I keep getting an error warning me about compatibility with windows 10 which did not used to occur Thank you in advance for anyone who takes the time to answer or recommend something Fallout 3 GOTY edition on steam keeps freezing windows 10,184,754,937

Fallout,So I ve had a glitch with Fallout New Vegas I am always getting infinite loading screens when I try to exit a certain areas of the map I don t think I loaded any auto saves which apparently causes issues with FNV I overwrite my last autosave I loaded saves from well before the glitch started happening I uninstalled and reinstalled etc Then I noticed that no matter what when I verify integrity of game files it tells me that 1 file failed to validate and will be reacquired Even if I verify and then immediately do it again it tells me this I don t know how to fix this issue but I suspect it has something to do with my current glitch Can anyone help me Every time I verify integrity of game files for Fallout New Vegas it tells me that 1 file failed to validate and will be reacquired even if I do it back to back I think it may have something to do with a game breaking glitch Can anyone help,178,720,897

Fallout,The first three games the main plot is or at least part of it is about the scarcity of food and water In New Vegas and FO4 food and water are not the hero s chief concerns but funnily enough those two games do have optional mechanics requiring food and water Ironically for as much as it gets derided Fallout 76 may be the only game where it perfectly matches up You re truly alone in the wilderness at least until the Wastelanders add on so survival is a major challenge so appropriately enough the survival mechanics in that game are mandatory I know there s a survival mode mod for Fallout 3 I don t suppose there s anything like that for Fallouts 1 and 2 is there Would that even be workable Wasteland 2 points to how that might be viable for the original Fallouts In the first three numbered games there should have been some kind of food water mechanics,163,697,859

Fallout,In case if you don t know what the Enclave are they re essentially a contingency plan for the United States government to survive in the event of nuclear war Their main base was a Poseidon oil rig on the coast of California however they were pretty much scattered throughout the United states My question is do you guys think nate knew about them He was serving around the time the Enclave was being established and he has just about the military background to be important enough to the United States to be shared secrets to him being a war hero and whatnot This is just a thought I had and one I discussed with my friend I ve been thinking about it more because I recently started an Enclave build in Fallout 4 I think it s possible but not probable The people who knew about the Enclave pre war were mainly government officials not necessarily war heroes Also if he knew about the Enclave nate would ve probably been moved to the Oil Rig and survived the Bombs there Do you think Nate knew about the Enclave,189,822,1010

Fallout,Hello fallout fans I showcasing an idea for fallout mod s new game set in New Mexico I need some feedback for this coming project and things that should be added in the future Here my design document intro Also if want a taste of what a fallout game set in New Mexico would look like try out Fallout 1 5 Resurrection Fallout 2 mod Note everything in this future project to change and I am still working on this project idea Fallout New Mexico takes place in May 2296 15 years after Fallout New Vegas and 9 years after Fallout 4 219 years after the great war With the death of Caesar during the events of Fallout New Vegas the legion quickly implodes into Civil War among Ceasar legion legates across Arizona New Mexico Colorado up to Denver and eastern Utah This lead to the event call Wars of legions which cause a 15 long war between the many legions across these regions This civil war is much like Alexander s Successor s Wars of the Diadochi who become successor states of Ptolemaic Kingdom and the Seleucid Empire At the same time this creates a Migration Period or known as the Barbarian Invasions where the western roman empire fell while the eastern roman empire becomes the byzantine empire Much like the events of the Migration Period the raider tribes and other legions factions fight to gain control remains of the Ceasar legion The Ceasars legates quickly fighting against each other and some of them simply split off from the legion to from their legions and forming their own identities While some of them turn back into raider gangs who raid the settlements across the New Mexico Wasteland Besides new and old raider tribes have moved to various parts of New Mexico Taking advantage of the chaos and lack of security to raid settlements in the region Settlements who are not under control by the legions return to their original identities and customs The lesser legions who survive the wars from their legion identities and customs across the wasteland control parts of New Mexico Wasteland By the time Fallout New Mexico starts there a massive struggle among major factions Where each of these major factions wants to take control of the New Mexico Wasteland 1 Kingdom of Santa Fe 2 The Midwest Brotherhood 3 The Reservation 4 Desert Rangers 5 Commonwealth Republic 6 NCR Rangers 7 Comanche Nation 8 The Nexus 9 Principality of New Constantinople 10 Kingdom of New Sweden 11 Republic of New Istanbul 12 Teutonic Legion 13 Alexander s Companions 14 Napoleon s Foreign Legion 15 Hannibal s Mercenary Band 16 Constantine s Legion 17 Red Legion 18 Augustus s Legion 19 Aurelian s Legion 20 Stilicho s and Aetius s Legion The Prisoner the player s character is more or less a clean slate up awakes in a locked cell after a recent prison riot had happened to leave them forever locked in the room The remaining guards and prisoners are left in the wastes One day the door in their cell mysteriously opens where a prisoner can more than fewer ventures the New Mexico wasteland and eventually change the New Mexico Wasteland forever Locations The are three main game worlds and alongside mini game worlds in New Mexico Wasteland The player can almost explore the whole New Mexico state as well parts of Mexico Texas Arizona Utah and Colorado Main game worlds 1 New Mexico Central Wasteland The World would encompass from surrounding areas around Albuquerque Santa Fe Los Alamos Springer and Taos 2 New Mexico Southern Wasteland The World would encompass from surrounding areas around Silver City El Paso Ciudad Juarez Mexico Las Cruces Deming Lordsburg Alamogordo Carlsbad and Roswell 3 New Mexico FourCorners Wasteland The World would encompass from surrounding areas around Four Corners Monument Monument Valley Ignacio Chinle Blanding Cortez Durango Farmington Shiprock Dove Creek and Navajo Lake State Park Mini game worlds These locations serve as their mini game worlds like The Witcher 3 game worlds of Kaer Morhen and Skellige and classical games of Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 1 New Mexico Gallup Wasteland The World would encompass from the surrounding area Gallup Zuni Reservation Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation Window Rock Ganado Chambers Thoreau Crownpoint and Grants 2 New Mexico Very Large Array Wasteland The World would encompass the surrounding area San Antonio Socorro Very Large Array Datil Alamo and Belen 3 New Mexico Fort Summer Wasteland The World would encompass from the surrounding area Lake Sumner Santa Rosa Tucumcari Fort Sumner Clovis Portales and Elida 4 New Mexico Craters Valley Wasteland The World would encompass from the surrounding area Mountainair Estancia Vaughn and Corona A number of meteors from space have crashed land this region Creating an alien landscape much like the Divide and big empty 5 New Mexico Jicarilla Apache Nation Reservation Wasteland The World would encompass from the surrounding area Dulce Chimney Rock Pagosa Springs Chama and Tierra Amarilla Fallout New Mexico Tone The main theme deals with aftershocks of Caesar s death regardless of what happen Fallout New Vegas and effects of civil war across New Mexico It deals with effects of a long prolong war ranging from the economy destruction of infrastructure labor force displacement education resources security gender civilian casualties artistic and other things that affect society from war It must deal with the effects of a newly fallen civilization in a post nuclear world where it s a return to the new Dark Age again The main times are inspired by the Roman Civil Wars and Migration Period throughout Roman history It will show a real sense of the decline of the Ceasar legion and New Mexico Wasteland as a whole much like the decline of the Western Roman Empire Fallout New Mexico An unofficial sequel of Fallout New Vegas,977,4780,5756

Fallout,As we learned from the Point Lookout DLC for FO3 Desmond Lockhart and Professor Calvert were seeking to destroy each other in an effort to become the winner of The Great Game The Wiki lists it as a Post War rivalry but if we remember from our conversation with Desmond he mentions that this started BEFORE the war and that he and Calvert weren t the only participants My question is Who else is playing Robert House Then man hellbent on self preservation to the point that he equipped his home at the Lucky 38 with laser cannons to destroy the 77 missiles headed towards Las Vegas The man who created his own life support device and placed himself inside before the imminent destruction of the world around him John Caleb Bradburton Similar story to House except with Nuka Cola Partners with Vault Tec to build his own Vault underneath Nuka World Has RobCo build his robotic security Partners with the US Gov t on Project Cobalt and blackmails them into helping him squeeze into the LEAP X Program Life Extension And Prolongation What do you think Is there anyone else that may be playing Let s discuss Who else is playing The Great Game,205,933,1137

Fallout,I ve played through the game a few times but never really went in for the romance and relationships I usually used Danse Preston Codsworth or Dogmeat as followers and maintained a more shall we say professional realtionship I ve been running with Piper recently and gone through all of her dialogue but due to my super hardcore mods my Specials are very low so I didn t meet the requirements for any of her romance options and just had to dunk her into the friendzone Is there any way to re trigger her romance dialogue Could I lower then raise her affinity I ll likely romance Curie anyway so I ll be prepared before travelling with her It just seems a little unfair if you can t ever have another go at pursuing a relationship if your Charisma was just a little low the first time around It s hard to predict when they ll stop you and present an opportunity to make a move Though you can postpone the dialogue until you re ready I guess What if you re under the effects of something that lowers your Charisma and you blow it I guess it s realistic in that way Just seems like a pretty harsh system especially for new players Fallout 4 romance system,218,934,1151
Fallout,Think bout it You have several interaction with amata during your childhood life You were friendly enough with amata for her to throw a surprise birthday for you Although not as important The overseer will always mention that not everybody likes you At the age of 16 18 Before goat test You can either help her and gain good k or join the fun for bad k or ignore Tunnel Snake bullying Amata because they rule and go inside the classroom to do the goat test which can imply Amata relationship with the Lone Wanderer during this time skip can mean Lone Wanderer is still her besties or stranger who used to be friend once upon a time or even worse who will also torment her just to gain the Tunnel Snake respect so they won t torment you or for the lols and the giggles because the Lone Wanderer is a psychopath sociopath From there Amata reason to help you because she deeply respect your Dad because hes literally a saint who has a very good karma even though you re probably worse than Butch And if you and Amata are still besties from your previous action She can help you more by giving you a 10mm pistol which of course she stole it from her dad So at one point you probably got yourself a 32 pistol or a chinese one After escaping vault 101 I mean seriously who just wake up from bed and start smashing people heads who you used to know since childhood The more you think about the flaws of BGS game the more you realize how incomplete it is rush the game But then you deeply appreciate how the director somehow didn t make the game Frontier quality plus New Vegas bugs which make the average buggy bethesda game not so buggy Its possible that in Fallout 3 You never meant to have a 10mm pistol easily without getting bad karma and or having to do certain thing to get one Which is why chinese pistol and 32 pistol is exist and weaker than 10mm pistol,353,1504,1856

Fallout,I recently saw a documentary on the Pepsi Number Fever in the Philippines Essentially in the midst of the so called Cola Wars of the 90s Pepsi wanted to boost their sales numbers against Coke They decided print numbers on bottle caps and announce the winning numbers in TV The winner would receive 1 million pesos a huge amount in a developing country The contest was wildly popular but also had a dark side leading to theft and murders over supposedly winning bottle caps Sound familiar In a massive fuckup one of the numbers Pepsi announced was previously printed as a losing number inadvertently leading some 800 winners Faced with the prospect of paying out such a massive sum Pepsi welched on the award leading to nationwide riots and more than a few deaths Since this event took place in 1992 I m wondering if the overlapping narratives are more than just coincidence Can anyone comment in this For your convenience I have attached the link to the Legend of the Star entry in the Fallout Wiki wiki Sunset_Sarsaparilla_star_bottle_cap Also the Pepsi Number Fever Wikipedia article https en wikipedia org wiki Pepsi_Number_Fever A year ago Bloomberg made a documentary about this event called The 90s Pepsi Contest That Turned Deadly watch v SChZyhpQJ_U amp t 335s Is the Philippine Pepsi Numbers Fever the inspiration for the Legend of the Star quest in FNV,233,1130,1362

Fallout,I just beat the entire game including DLC s The game was absolutely awful It amazes me how shallow it is I hated all of the DLC s I especially hated the Nuka World story It was lame to hedge out areas and have total control over anything And becoming a raider sucked Clearly a half assed attempt to shove in an evil path and it clashed horribly I should have brought Nick Valentine with me when I did this so I could have a reason to shoot his ass I constantly found myself bored to tears with the story and wondered when it would all end I bet the writer shat out this story thinking we would all focus on settlement building Overall the game was garbage I really really hope they give Fallout 5 to a developer who gives a shit Uninstalling this dumpster fire from my PC Once again fuck Bethesda This game was dogshit I just beat Fallout 4 It was absolute garbage,167,698,864

Fallout,So for those of you who are new to the game need an early start or simply didn t know about this there s a very easy xp exploit in Fallout New Vegas right as you start the game It requires a lot of patience strong will and a speech or barter skill of at least 25 Go to the saloon in good springs and do the bear minimum for the tutorial After that talk to joe cobb after the fight in the bar and tell him you ll help him take over good springs Kill Ringo and return to him where he ll tell you to meet his gang I recommend saving before you then start killing him and his men shouldn t be much of a challenge depending on difficulty After they re dead go to the general store to the left of the saloon and talk to Chet There will be an infinite speech barter check to give ammo and leather armour to the powder gangers Keep doing this for a few hours and you ll also have an unlimited amount of caps as you can sell the leather armour and wait for his stock to resupply The xp you get from the speech check will level you up after doing it again and again New Vegas XP exploit,222,855,1076
Fallout,I really wan na see other people s opinions about this Because time and time again Bethesda has shown that they have no idea how to make a proper Fallout game From the railroad mess that is fallout 3 The admittedly good shooter but still terrible rpg that is Fallout 4 And finally the broken mess that not even the biggest contrarians will defend that is Fallout 76 When Obsidian was given the chance they made Fallout New Vegas in only 18 months It ultimately shows that in my opinion Bethesda has no right to make game after game that ruins the legacy of a franchise that deserves better Now I d like to see what everyone else thinks Should Bethesda just outright sell Fallout to likely Obsidian Should Bethesda sell Fallout Discussion,133,605,737

Fallout,America gets covered in ashes and a large radius around the volcano would be pretty much completely decimated It d be really hard to find land suitable for growing crops but there are locations and raider gangs are at an all out war to claim said land Instead of feral ghouls we get Bloaters ferals with skin equivalent to the thing s skin with lava flowing through the cracks The bloaters would be able to spew out lava at enemies and explode in a min nuke size explosion two seconds after death spraying lava everywhere Other wasteland creatures would look like the ones you see in the games but also special ones with similar skin to these bloaters and blow up just like the bloaters Wanting to face a lava deathclaw would be a Deathwish The larger Diamond City Sized cities built fortified cities and have deterents for these bloaters to avoid total destruction of their settlements The raider gangs have power based on claimed land killing each other to take more land Land for slaves to grow food and nurture their needs Lakes and rivers are either covered in ash cooled the spilt lava into stone or left untouched The untouched waters are valuable to the raider gangs but seawater at coastal areas are purified for use too The area right at the vicinity of the yellowstone volcano is still packed with hot stones and lava The perfect place for people to have their final battles and final stands A finale for the many storylines that could occur in this world This world is pretty much hell or the underworld in real life without the demons amp x200B Anyway I got bored and decided to write all this In an alternate Fallout Universe where one nuke was dropped inside the Yellowstone supervolcano instead of multiple around America,308,1430,1737

Fallout,I never realized how different the game feels if you decide going straight to DLC play them as the alternate first act I went level 1 into Sierra Madre Old World blues after it then Honest Hearts and ended with Lonesome road By the end of it I went through 20 levels and most important stats for my character were on 100 I have a arsenal to clear the entire Fort and McCaren with ease and a kickass crib in the Elijah s bunker Confronting Benny and talking to factions of Mojave feels entirely different It feels like they trully fear your character The lines are the same but since your character went about you feel like a well equipped and experienced curior I even started to read all my lines like Jason Statham in the Transporter lol Maybe because it feels fresh but this is my new favorite way to start a New Vegas playthrough next time ill just go the other way around with the DLCs New Vegas and DLCs,172,738,909

Fallout,TL DR Different intros What are your thoughts Is this good bad Ideas for different intros Read more to understand what I m trying to say If you don t want to read the Cyberpunk part just look at the other bold text amp x200B Minor and insignificant spoilers for the first 20 minutes of Cyberpunk and one quest Cyberpunk was described as a RPG before its release One of the most interesting features was the multiple intros Street Kid Nomad or Corpo that would give you a unique beginning quests background to the story faction reputations based on your intro and just allow you to give your character a personality based on how they join the story However in Cyberpunk each character turns into the same one Street Kid Merc through a quick cutscene even the Corpo an office labourer who is likely a bit of an asshole caught up in the rat race of big business who is tasked to assassinate the boss of their boss For the Corpo character you get ready to plan your assassination but then suddenly have your corporate status stripped from you and get introduced to the game properly this is where that 20 minute cutscene comes in I don t have a problem with you getting stripped of your corporate identity this is a decent way to introduce the player into the main story of the game and set up an intriguing revenge redemption or comeback plot My only problem is that the game doesn t really do either of these things You become a Street Kid Merc because the game wants you to be as it fits with all the best with most quests in the game I would have preferred for the player to have been given a choice between what kind of affect this event has on their character For example a disgraced Corpo could See this as an opportunity for themselves to be redeemed or atleast reborn moving away from their avaricious past to become a mercenary who serves the people Maybe this changes their morals making them more of a harsh inhospitable outlaw or a type of Robinhood taking from corporations and giving back to the people Seek revenge against those who harmed them They could do this by becoming anti establishment and destroying corporations similar to the Robinhood idea but with much more anarchy Alternatively they could wish to seek revenge by climbing the corporate ladder again legally or illegally only to claim control of the business they were once fired from and deal punishment to those who stripped them of their lowly worker status See this as punishment for failing to be a good worker and re enter the vicious corporate world falling into perdition But unfortunately the game seems to want to force you into one role But this got me thinking What about something like this for Fallout Imagine starting as a tribal raider group a cult follower a rich brahmin baron a brotherhood scribe a Legion remanent Enclave remanent etc Perhaps even Ghoul or Mutant intros could be an option I like this idea because it is good for roleplaying and allows you to be introduced to the world in a way that doesn t mean you start off alone or in a small town and slowly expand outwards exploring different factions You start with knowledge of the world and then expand allowing you to make decisions based on what you already know This would break up the formula Fallout games seem to fall into and also give great replay value It would also mean that the intro the game won t be a boring thing you have to mod out suffer through when you start up the game as shorter intro will be incentivized because producing 3 20 min 1 hour long intros is hard I would ideally like you to just be thrown into the first quest 5 minutes into the game similar to New Vegas There is a lot of opportunity here What are your thoughts Is this good bad Ideas for different intros Multiple Fallout Intros,688,3087,3774

Fallout,I know why buckle up kids prepare to learn some history and do some reading The Chinese during the Final years of the Sino American war 2074 2077 were pushed back on all fronts in Alaska and in south east Asia fo4 confirms this The Chinese mainland was now under direct threat of American invasion and it was American forces invaded east central china in 2074 the Yangtze became a warzone a warzone that became a stalemate The stalemate became broken after The us army field tested its Superior T51 power armor for the first time Chinese supply lines from the nations it annexed started to break down The us took advantage and started to invade the strategically vital city s of shanghai and Nanjing with the loss of major citys provinces military resources began to become scarce In the gobi desert things were not looking good for the Chinese either military bases were being overrun and they were loosing soldiers at a record number Thanks to the help of T51 units ripping through Chinese battalions And American forces fighting all throughout china slowly creeping their way towards The capital the fall of Beijing looked imminent The Chinese were desperate they did not need to win the war they just needed to bring the Americans to the negotiating table My theory is that CHINESE INTELLIGENCE came up with the IDEA OF A SMALL SCALE INVASION OF THE EASTERN SEABOARD ALTHOUGH MORE PREDOMINANTLY FOCUSED ON THE D C AREA enough to scare the Us to negotiate OK HEAR ME OUT in fallout 3 we constantly come across Chinese officer swords pistols and assault rifles that are being used by wastelanders 200 years after the bombs fell that just should show how prepared those bastards were and the sheer amount of hardware they brought on top of that we come across the Chinese remnants of mama dolces and a few other commandos and Agents across the wasteland you could be asking they might not have the numbers for an invasion nope that s were ur wrong its actually a silver lining The American populace during the Sino American war were tired of the food shortages the government and the loss of life they were ready for something new hell Wasn t martial law established Didn t riots happen due to the government s neglect and abuse its safe to say that some people in America started to embrace communism and would be willing to uprise against the feds Thats were the Chinese agents commandos come in they came into America under the fase alias of being workers or whatnot like in mama dolces and they would start training communist sympathizers to build a Militia to overthrow the government hence why there are so many fucking Chinese named weapons in the capitol wasteland it wasn t exactly for the the agents it was for the home grown commie militia Even the communist radio America broadcast in fallout 3 is targeted towards Americans to show them that that their war was unjust and that the wall street gang was lining their pockets specifically trying to have them change sides Lets go to the appliachia in 76 you will see the liberators small Chinese robots all over the wasteland on them are what Propaganda flyers made to change the hearts and minds of American citizens and in the deep there is a Chinese base inside the base there is a terminal in the terminal it says operation piercing viper has commenced or something like that I believe operation piercing viper might be the code name for this plan I ll wrap it up now in a nice little bow I believe that the Chinese at the end of the war were desperate to not loose using The american populaces uneasiness towards the federal government the Chinese came up with a plan to inspire Americans to change their worldview while using commandos to infiltrate inside the united states to Form Arm again the abundance of Chinese weapons in fo3 and strengthen an underground military force to rebel against the us government Similar to how the us uses special forces to do the exact same thing in our real world Uh Jesus it took me like an hour to type this eh spelling grammar and stuff but I ve been thinking about this for a while anyways and I ve always wondered why ever since i played fo3 why theres so much Chinese shit anyways hope u guys enjoyed and maybe learned something Why is there so much Chinese weapon equipment in fallout 3,767,3530,4296

Fallout,Every day people are trying to find new possible locations for the next game However I see very few people thinking of North Dakota as a possible location I do however think North Dakota could be one for a couple reasons One is the possible chance of DLC to South Dakota to visit Mount Rushmore and create some crazy story But the bigger and better reasons is something called the Stanley R Mickelsen Safeguard Complex This is a building the US government spent 6 billion on but was only open for one day If you look at photos of this building it looks like a pyramid without a cap which can create some nice story particularly towards the Illuminati This could also add some story as the main objective of this complex was to deter missle attacks which can fit into the story of Fallout and who launched the first nuke in some way Please look into this building as it is a gold mine for conspiracies and possible stories and tell Bethesda about it New possible location for a Fallout game,182,808,989

Fallout,While the nature of the Stranger is of course a mystery I think I have a reasonably compelling argument to shine some light on who he is and more importantly who he works for We do not know if the Stranger is a person or just a title However this theory works in either scenario First we have to ask ourselves what do we know of the Stranger what are his attributes 1 He appears when we use V A T S with our Pip Boy and vanishes just as quickly 2 He wears a Fedora and a Trench Coat 3 He helps out the player regardless of their reputation with any faction or their Karma amp x200B Since he only appears if we are using V A T S we can assume that the activation of VATS causes him to know our location and that we are in danger VATS is Pip Boy technology and who designed Pip Boys Vault Tec Presumably he has access to very advanced technology as he can teleport to our position then teleport away Next we know he wears a fedora and trench coat What other character wears this outfit The Vault Tec representative who visits the player of Fallout 4 before the bombs hit We know he is not affiliated with any other faction because he doesn t care if all the other factions hate us so that means he is either a neutral entity or working for a different faction somewhere out there in the wastes My theory is that the Stranger is being employed by a Post War Vault Tec to manipulate events from behind the scenes and ensure certain historical figures who use VATS are allowed to complete their adventures There are other factions such as the Talon Company Mercs who seem to be getting all their funding and supplies from some unknown source as if they too were being employed by this same shady company What is Post War Vault Tec doing I don t know for sure but the pieces seem to fit My Mysterious Stranger theory who is he and who does he work for,358,1488,1845

Fallout,dl2lW0f png Most of the essential info is in the image but most of it is a very rough outline Essentially it d be a pretty large map with a clear distinction between civilised land and factions vs wild land and factions The wild land would be very survival heavy Vehicles boats would be especially handy and ridable animals could be a great way to make travel fast and interesting Those who do not like this can still fast travel of course There are no faction names yet so I ll refer to factions by their main settlement or their lifestyle Obv the map wouldnt be 1 1 to real life but still very large General things about the setting Most communities and settlements are only armed with small arms This lack of heavy weapons is the reason for walls becoming a viable defensive structure for settlements Not only do they protect settlements from hostile people but also from mutated wildlife smelling easy snacks behind the walls Trade caravans are much more protected in civilized land than in other Fallout titles They may carry more advanced goods but robbing them will be especially difficult in the early game Wild areas even non irradiated ones will feature a far greater focus on survival than other FO titles Players should think carefully what they do with their limited inventory space if they plan on heading into these areas or have to due to quests Rare loot abandoned military bases raider outposts and hidden settlements should break up the regrowth of nature over the fields from time to time About side quests Faction related side quests should make the final battle easier or harder depending on which faction you do these quests for and which one you side with in the main quest line For example If you re negotiating an arms trade deal as a high charisma character for the St Louis faction and later choose to side with the Lord of Springfield it should make your battle harder because your enemy will have better guns On the other hand leading an expedition against the raiders while siding with St Louis could make your side have more people in the final battle since you just freed up a great amount of forces that were tied down with trade protection Non faction minor faction related side quests should have little influence on the main quest line They should be immediately rewarding rather than having an effect later on Possible Faction Backstories Nomadic Raiders and River Pirates Before they turned to raiding the nomads tried to establish their own farming communities After being left near starving following repeated drought years they began wandering in search of a new home During their journey they found a caravan escorted by a group of riders The nomads in their desperation attacked this caravan after having their pleas for food refused and seized everything from weapons to animals to food After this success they slowly drifted into a lifestyle of raiding everything they could However internal distrust quickly grew among them and a group of exiles set themselves up in Quincy might need to be renamed to due identical name in FO4 where they found a few old boats anchored riverside They repaired what they could and started a career of piracy on the Mississippi St Louis Faction After repeated attacks on their river shipping by aforementioned pirates a group of semi wealthy traders set came together in the ruins of St Louis to start an alliance to defend themselves against the pirates Growing closer and closer together they began to form their own government in which the traders looked out for each other but not necessarily for the people in their territories Becoming a stabilising factors in the region meant it become wealthy which in turn meant they became an important destination for other traders in along the Mississippi The feudal state in Springfield Springfield being a relatively lucky city having not been directly hit during the Great War still faced severe problems in the immediate aftermath The Fallout from the warheads that hit St Louis still heavily decimated its population and the population surrounding it During this time the chief of Springfields police who survived the Fallout organised a militia out of the policemen who were lucky enough not to die from the Fallout Declaring himself the Lord of Springfield he and his men started to impose their own order on the local population disregarding most ideas of state from the pre war era After having established themselves as a local power they approached settlements in the immediate vicinity of Springfield with offers to either join them or be conquered Those who joined them still retained a relatively large degree of autonomy being able to organise their territories however they wanted to so long as they paid tribute to the Lord Due to the spread out nature of the settlements under the Lord they were allowed to retain their own militias but also had to contribute a few soldiers for the Lord s army every few years While the Lord has passed long ago his state has survived so far and his more benevolent descendants have taken the reigns Ghoul Tribes Despite living among humans for quite some time distrust between them and humans reached a tipping point after a local ghoul gang made the streets of St Louis unsafe One of St Louis most important traders seized this as an opportunity to gain a large political following which he used in an election year to quickly intimidate his political opponents into retreating from the stage Through this he managed to win the election and made good on his promise to take revenge on ALL ghouls inside the walls of St Louis expelling most of them except those who were on this man s good side before the ghoul gang incidents After being expelled from the city the ghouls quickly dispersed into many small communities to the east of the city hoping to be let back in one day The start of the territorial conflict between St Louis and Springfield A few of the current Lord s subjects felt the tributes to be too humiliating to continue any longer In their dissatisfaction they secretly began negotiations to join the traders of St Louis who promised them much greater respect and great autonomy to them while demanding to be granted exclusive trade rights on the Illinois river After a promise of being backed up by the traders the Lord s subjects on the river declared secession from their Lord Not knowing what awaited them the Lord only sent a small force to restore order This small force had quickly been crushed by the combined troops of the former subjects and the mercenaries employed by the traders I d love to hear any suggestion on what could be improved with this rough idea What do you think Had an idea yesterday on a possible future

Fallout,Alright I ve been thinking and this was probably obvious and I m just oblivious to finding a post to it but if it s already been talked about tell me so I can delete this So recently I watched a fallout iceberg video and in the comment section I saw someone make a theory about the god like beings dunwich came across it wasn t that good of a theory he made but it made something click in my head probably a theory just as bad what if the zetans were looking for the those godly creatures that dunwich was looking for What if those other worldly eldritch creatures are enemies of the zetans and present a major threat to the zetan race so they feel the need to find them and eliminate them The other worldly creatures I m referring to are the ones you find in dunwich buildings and the interloper creatures found in fallout 76 I noticed that zetans tend to be in the regions that contain statues and eldritch themed creatures like what if the flatswoods monsters are zetan scouts trying to look for the location of the dormant interloper so they can destroy it when it s most vulnerable and weak As far as I know the interloper is the only large actual organism in the Fallout games you can physically find other than statues so like what if there s all this constant zetans scouting west virginia just for the 2 interloper creatures that are living there What if all the eldritch entities come from the same face of supernatural aliens that can cause people to hallucinate and make them slaves by invoking fear for them to pray causing an illusion that they re godly entities such as what happens with the cultists each time we see these creatures they cause some form of hallucination except the one in 76 because it s dormant maybe it was attacked and put to near death and feeds off the prayers by the cultist Basically what if the zetans killed a bunch of these creatures and weakened so many in some really long war on some planet that the remainder of them fled to earth in hopes of feeding of the fooled that they made fear them with the hallucination like power that they have This theory is pretty bad but I just felt like sharing what do you think what would make this theory better or should I just not ever say any of this again Fallout theory zetans are trying to search and destroy the eldritch gods,433,1882,2314
Fallout,Good Afternoon So ever since I played Fallout 4 I have been wondering about this At the time the game takes place the NCR and East Coast BoS chapter are both allies this is supported by the fact that Maxon has had contact with the East Coast Chapter Since both the NCR and BOS are massive in size now would the two eventually clash over territory in a few hundred years I imagine that since the NCR is always expanding and looking for new territory and the BoS try to civilize most areas I wouldn t say it s impossible to see them meeting somewhere in the middle Also while we re on the topic of massive factions in the wasteland what is the mid west chapter doing now From what I understand they were cast away after a disagreement with the East Coast but they still control hundreds of miles of territory What are your thoughts on all of this What Happens When The NCR amp West Coast BoS Eventually Meet,172,734,905

Fallout,I ll start this by saying I love fallout I ve only played the 3d games but have enjoyed them all immensely and love digging into the lore established in all of the games When 76 was announced I was beyond hyped An online fallout game I could play with my friends sounded like everything I d ever dreamed of as a kid Then it finally came out and was absolute trash Quests didn t work leveling didn t work combat didn t work building didn t work just the whole thing was fucked Me and my friends tried getting into it but it was just too buggy and broken so we moved on to other games When the wastelanders update launched a while later I d begun seeing people saying the game had become much better so me and one of my friends tried to give it another chance The first new quest we tried was broken so we again abandoned the game I was wondering if things have improved in any way since then or if we were possibly too quick to dismiss the game on the second try I really wanted to enjoy this game and so did all of my friends but it just fell so short at launch that I m sure most of them wouldn t consider returning Should I join them in forgetting this game or should I give it another chance What kind of changes have been made to improve on the games early failings Wondering if I should give 76 another try,261,1051,1311
Fallout,Old World Blues is one of my favorite DLCs in Fallout New Vegas but it has some major flaws and technically this should actually be titled Dead Money is World Breaking but it stems from Big Mountain Dead Money introduces the player to vending machines that are used basically in theory solve the Resource Wars or at least shortage It would have been one thing if they were experimental and only given out to the Sierra Madre with the many other deals and contracts between Frederick Sinclair and Big Mountain but it is instead stated that these machines were seen at the World s Fair Exhibit So this miracle machine was able to make resources out of thin air and well they couldn t quite change that the Great War happened Old World Blues is World Breaking,137,620,756

Fallout,Like the title says I want to hear some of your favorite ways you or someone you know has defended the castle from the Institute To start after fixing the walls and setting up the standard turrets around the wall I decided a bunch of lasers wasn t the most fun way to defend the throne of my empire I built a few mirelurk cages on the far side and then a deathclaw cage on the side with the door After that I decided to wall in the door so no synths could get in unless they teleported With a bunch of empty space inter door I filled it with flamethrowers turrets and moving sawblades so that my inner Macaulay Culkin would be pleased With all of the preparations completed I decided to let them throw themselves at my mayhem The first two waves ran into the murder room and lasted a solid second and a half before being chopped burned and riddled with lead Then the third wave hit I decided it was time to unleash the kraken and opened up my cages As I ran along the wall two glowing mirelurk hunters and a mirelurk deep king demolished one side while my chameleon deathclaw sneakily tore the others to shreds By the time they were done with the synth bastards the final wave was teleported inside the castle walls getting torn apart by Dance Strong piper Preston Mcready and my man valentine As I stood on the walls sniping who I could I turned around to realize I had Godzilla vs King Ghidorah as the deathclaw and Mirelurk king were fighting to prove who would be my champion As the fighting and the synths died down I looked upon the warriors of my empire and prepared to wave a war the likes the commonwealth hadn t seen since 1776 Stories of the Battle for the Castle,318,1357,1674

Fallout,My first experience in Dead Money was on a pure guns character which made combat an extremely tedious slog I thought going in on a melee weapons character might let me judge it more fairly because a lot of my hatred for the DLC was tied to how tedious and repetitive combat was Playing melee definitely expedited the combat but I still didn t find anything to enjoy about it Rant about why I hate this DLC below Dead money is by far the most visually and mechanically bland DLC for me Aesthetically there is just nothing there It s an endless series of identical grey corridors you are forced to progress through in a linear fashion Gameplay wise it is very different from anything else in the game but different doesn t mean better or interesting It s only different in the fact that it removes all the variety in enemies and weapons and makes you fight the same copy paste enemy with the same boring unsatisfying weapons for the length of the entire DLC As a guns character you are given two guns and neither of them feel like they have any feedback and you have to shoot a limb over and over and over waiting for it to randomly explode It s the most mind numbingly boring tedious combat experience I ve ever had in New Vegas As a melee weapons character combat is totally trivialized Just special attack with the knife spear to knock them down and spam left click That s all you have to do here entire DLC It s not fun but at least its over quickly Haven t tried energy weapons but there s no way I m subjecting myself to this DLC a third time I would be totally fine with the DLC taking all my weapons away if it had anything good to replace them with but all the weapons in this DLC are incredibly unsatisfying Maybe part of that feeling is due to the lack of enemy variety but it s not a good experience either way Beyond combat all the other mechanics also seem designed not really to challenge you in any way but to waste as much of your time as possible The radios are not a challenge They just make you walk in and out of rooms looking for them They needlessly slow you down The fog doesn t really present a threat It just forces you to spend 30 seconds holding E on a sink after going through it maximizing the amount of time you need to subject your eyes to the aforementioned identical grey corridors Speaking of which I never got this intense survival horror vibe people sometimes attribute to this DLC and I play on Very Hard in Hardcore mode I m not going to tell people to git gud It could be some of them just aren t abusing mechanics the way I did and I m glad if they got that experience Scrounging for resources in the first 15 minutes was genuinely fun for me Switching to my fists to kill a radroach without wasting durability on the pipe I found was fun Of course you ll have literally more weapons than you can carry after that because most ghost people carry like 6 of them Health isn t really an issue because there are sinks everywhere with a 5 1 HP Rad ratio which is essentially unlimited healing and once you find the code to turn chips into stimpacks you ll have more healing than you ll ever need I never spent chips on anything other than stims because everything else was kind of useless and I left the DLC with 180 stimpacks on the hardest difficulty That doesn t really feel like a resource crunch to me And then at the end of the DLC it tries to tie its themes together with the gold bars which would be a neat idea if the confrontation with Elijah wasn t so poorly done Even with 100 stealth and a stealth boy active he will immediately detect you if you so much as caps walk within 15 feet of him even if his back is turned He will pivot instantly to face you It feels like its hard coded and has nothing to do with your actual stealth That s reinforced by the fact that he automatically detects you if you get close to either door even if all the same conditions apply and he s across the room or not even in the room yet Except for one of the doors during one part of his scripted walk sequence What a lazy way to do a stealth sequence And even then there s multiple ways to get out with all the gold which sort of undermines the theme but that really doesn t matter because the theme was already undermined If you have any decent amount of luck you can easily walk out of the casino with 15k pre war money A 1 1 exchange rate between Sierra madre chips and stacks of pre war money is just ridiculous but apparently that s what they went with so by the time you actually get to the vault the gold bars are essentially worthless to you I only took them with out of spite for the DLC thinking it had earned the right to have themes at the end of the slog that it put me through TL DR It all sucks Except the story and characters And some of the dialogue Those range from decent to good but are not worth suffering through the rest of it I just played Dead Money for the second time and I still think it s awful,963,3988,4950
Fallout,I ve been a huge fan of the fallout games for over 10 years just got done playing New Vegas for the 3rd time I ve never played 76 before due to all the horrible reviews when it first came out but I see they ve released new downloadable content since then Is it worth playing through fallout 76 with the updates Is Fallout 76 worth playing,67,272,338

Fallout,I m sorry if this is a copy subject for the subreddit In vault 111 when Kellogg kills your spouse take Sean and looks at you and goes at least we still have a backup the reason why you were the backup is because if something were to happen to Sean they could still use you But when did gen 3 synth program was working pretty good the director at the time decided to clear up a few loose ends by killing the last vault dweller from vault 111 then Sean becomes the director of The institute and finds out that his parents both died in vault 111 so what Sean does is he takes out Nate Nora corpse from the cryopod puts in the synth Nate Nora then he lets you out a few years later to see what would happen I just think the soul survivor is a synth because it makes sense they clear up one loose end in a vault Why I believe the soul survivor is a synth,173,677,849
Fallout,As you know they did say at E3 that they want to eventually add Modding Capabilities to 76 I believe the way they should implement it is by making it where they should make private servers free like they originally intended but keep Fallout 1st as like a premium thing for example private servers could be free to everyone for modding your game but if you want to pay for a premium where you get scrap boxes monthly exclusive items and monthly free atoms then you can They should make private servers free so people can mod them as they wish new weapons new armors adding new quests and new worlds They should also add modding capabilities to public servers but extremely limited Mods like retextures and maybe some animation mods that change things in certain ways It would work just like skyrim together you can use certain mods on public servers that modify textures and animation as long as it doesn t modify things like weapon damage armor resistance etc Since the mods downloaded are retextures and don t modify stats in any way only other people with the same mods can see them For example If someone ported Vivid Fallout to fallout 76 and was using it on a public server only said person s game will look different to other people who don t have vivid fallout installed it will look normal If they ported right handed Handmade Rifle animations to 76 only said person and others with the same mod downloaded will see the animation change but others without the animation mod will see the normal animation What do you guys think Fallout 76 Modding Idea,280,1279,1558
Fallout,Most of the vaults in the series have some sort of experiment that they re based around which is typically insidious in nature like how Vault 22 was made to combat world hunger Vault 111 was made to test the long term effects of cryogenic preservation on human subjects and Vault 87 was used to study the effects of the Forced Evolutionary Virus on humans Since we ve seen so many interesting vault experiments in the series it makes me wonder if Bethesda or possibly Obsidian will delve into vaults with different ideologies It might sound like a bland idea when you can just apply differing ideologies to the factions present throughout the game but imagine something like a vault experiment being to have a self contained authoritarian democracy While this experiment was originally intended to be contained to the vault alone over the years the elected overseer decided to enter the wasteland and spread their empire throughout the area This would create an interesting faction that s based from one of the game s key vaults Do you think that vaults that have an experiment based around a specific ideology would be interesting or boring,196,946,1141
Fallout,If we ever get a new fallout game one thing I d love to see is more music made post war Magnolia made some bops and the raider radio in nuka world well it s not good music but it s music The lonesome drifter made some good stuff even if they were songs that already existed with post war stuff added to them Listen if people are able to make porn in new Reno then I m sure some people can make more music out in the wastes and some could even get on the radio in whatever area they are in It would give to some creative music too maybe an old enclave soilder writes about his past and you find his holotape with his song about it or maybe an old wasteland legend such as the vault dweller chosen one or lone wanderer is immortalized in a song sung by tuneful mercs on boring caravan nights Just a thought More post war music would be nice,169,670,838
Fallout,After nearly 10 years of trying to get this game to run on anything from an E machine a 2k work station an old lap top a new laptop and nine different computers I ve never successfully gotten it to run It s now 2021 I want to play fallout 3 after all these years I go to get the games for windows live since apparently that is step one for the 12 step program that is trying to install fallout 3 Turns out the link is dead Even with the mods that disable the need for it you still need it installed on your computer so that it can find it at all But it s abandon wear and no longer available So next I understand that you need to have it set so it believes it s running on a one core system for your computer to be recognized I ve done every step in the book but never gotten the game to run is there any suggestions guides etc To be completely blunt I am so dead set on finally just getting this game to run is there another service to buy it on for easier access on PC Fallout 3 is still unplayable Any advice and help,211,810,1020
Fallout,When i first completed Vanilla F4 i thought it was great one of my favorite games by far But then i decided to replay it full of mods and boy oh boy It is incredible how mods can change the feel of the game and how much you can make it fun for yourself it has infinite possibilities from making it a Hardcore Survival game to a complete horror experience a tactical modern shooter or even a full zombie game And the graphics weather texture mods they are truly a wonder completing F4 on a map full of snow felt amazing And the small quirky dumb mods like the laser guns sound replacer that makes every gun sound like pew or the thomas the train classic mod just make me want to play more and more And as a OG XOne player i truly appreciate all the performance patches and fps fixes specially around Diamond city because Vanilla just straight goes 15 20 fps when just walking around the city and with all the patches and stuff it goes up to solid 30 fps which is fine to me and 40 50 fps anywhere else with fps unlocker And i can t even imagine how good mods got ta be on PC i just hope one day i can build myself a great PC to fill Fallout 4 with 200 mods and spend the rest of my free time playing haha Fallout 4 is good but Fallout 4 modded is the best game ever,254,1011,1264

Fallout,I have heard time and time again that when lanius becomes Caesar the legion will fall but in my opinion it will not because he does not think it is his divine right to conquer the ncr like Caesar does in fact he thinks the west is a trap that the bear is stuck in Caesar main goal is to combine the ncr and the legion together by getting rid of the ncr counsel and making a military dictatorship and with all the citizens and infrastructure create a power empire But the thing is the lands Caesar has conquered are rich with resources so maybe lanius can build a empire without conquering the ncr Is legate lanius a good leader,120,508,627

Fallout,One of my favorite experiences in any open world game is getting to a location I can t fast travel to The simple getting from point A to point B makes even mundane tasks interesting As the player progresses from early to mid game fast travel becomes more widely used Fast travel is convenient and does reduce grind Fast travel is all well and good but it decreases the amount of interaction the player has with the game world To put it simply the strength of a open world game should be in the player s interaction with the world But you can have your cake and eat it to via a fast travel system similar to that seen in The Witcher 3 In The Witcher 3 fast travel is based on a series of location throughout the game world These fast travel locations are common enough that they are convenient but spread out enough that they don t completely remove non fast travel It s a little mechanic that I think would add a lot of depth to the gameplay Location based fast travel as seen in The Witcher 3 s signposts is a smart update of isometric Fallout s exit grid system and would be a great addition to the next entry in the series,217,909,1125

Fallout,I kinda had enough of the whole chosen one type character Fallout 1 destroying the unity destroying the super mutants Fallout 2 you are literally called the chosen Need i say more Fallout 3 u literally help bos fight muties Fallout 4 you destroy an entire scientific organisation with an army of robots that have been making muties Nv your just a courier who gets involved in war who clears an entire mountain of muties In all these games most of these characters shouldn t be able to kill a super mutant with in the first 000 01 milliseconds of seeing one The only one id say could is the courier and chosen cuz they has lived in the wastes but still they should die But ss and lw and and vd shouldn t they all have been in vaults The sight of one should make em wee in there undies and not the combat ability s of an us special ops super soldier Hell all of these people should be killed by feral ghouls as they are irradiated and fast the literally main character would have cancer from being attacked by a horde or hell even die from radiation poisoning Fallout 4 muties are to easy to kill I guarantee you could kill one with a pipe pistol Hell the vault dweller killed so many super mutants He strolled over to mariposa and the church and killed so many super mutants like if he was tying his shoes And in my rage just now I don t actually think muties where in fallout 2 And thus began the re play through of fallout 2 A rant on vault dwellers and super mutants,283,1186,1468

Fallout,Anyone else bothered by the way certain apparel that was good Fallout 3 isn t very good in New Vegas First of all the Chinese Stealth Armor is pretty much useless now as it doesn t have the Stealth Field that it had in Fallout 3 I mean don t get me wrong it was pretty OP but it was locked behind a relatively difficult DLC and had a very poor condition level meaning it was only really useful if you wanted to sneak around without engaging in combat They could ve at least made the Chinese Stealth Armor much harder to obtain to compensate for it s over poweredness or lock the Stealth Field behind a Perk or something And now we move onto the Merc Outfits which were pretty good in Fallout 3 for how much DR they gave combined with how easy they were to obtain early on They had 12 DR by the way which judging how DR translates to DT in New Vegas you d think the Merc Outfits would have at least 7 DT right But no they made it 1 DT Why I m guessing people will defend it and say that this makes it more realistic Well I don t see what s so realistic about Joshua Graham s Armor having a DT of 15 despite just being a collared formal shirt underneath a SWAT Tactical Vest or those god awful rags and Ugg Boots Veronica wears having a DT of 6 Fallout New Vegas nerfed certain apparel,256,1028,1283
Fallout,i have played through both games on my ps4 which i have sold and gotten a gaming pc and i really wan na play some modern fallout i have already gotten new vegas and fallout 3 but im really split on which one when it comes to fallout 4 ive done everything there was to do ive played with every faction gotten every power armour and i got a platinum trophy which means i got every single collectible but on pc i can mod it and experience new stuff right i dont know if thats worth it when it comes to fallout 76 i was level 256 or something like it and i played fallout 76 ever since the first beta but i didnt really play steel dawn so i guess i can play that if i get 76 and also i can experience the story all over again with npc s this time but honestly my biggest turn off is the grind it was the worst most painful part of the game to have to grind for things non stop because everything breaks in 5 seconds and i grinded the queen for repair kits but they run out super fast i cant decide i want a second opinion from other fans I cant decide if i should buy Falllout 4 or Fallout 76,224,865,1088
Fallout,To enhance the reading experience listen to this watch v 730jXH_Ni7Y while reading 1 The Prydwen wreckage proves to be very valuable to the Minutemen as tons of building materials is scavenged from the scrap that was once the Brotherhood of Steel s Mobile Command Center Any weapons armor and even Power Armor that survived the explosion is repaired and used by the Minutemen 2 After being ousted as a Synth Mayor McDonough is publicly executed in defiance of the now former Institute It is decided that Diamond City will no longer have a Mayor but is instead run by a City Council Nick Piper Arturo Travis Moe Dr Sun and Danny are given chairs on the Council and run the City as equals 3 The reformation of the Commonwealth Provisional Government is once again brought up and The Minutemen Diamond City and Goodneighbor are the first to join it with several other Settlements in The Commonwealth join soon after and soon become a major force on the East similar to the NCR in the West The General was elected the first President of the NCPG and served for many years 4 Synth Shaun continues to live alongside his mother father tinkering inventing and improving various machines and gizmos he finds around his home 5 The Raiders of Nuka World were no match for The General and their Minutemen With Mags William Mason Lizzie Nisha Dixie and Savoy dead the leaderless Raiders who survived The Minutemen s attack fled into the wastes to either join new gangs or had simply died Nuka World became a major City and Trading Hub within the New Commonwealth Provisional Government NCPG for short 6 After helping out the Residents of Far Harbor Acadia and the surrounding Settlements they agree to join the NCPG and they begin installing more Fog Condensers on the Island almost permanently extinguishing the Fog 7 After gaining enough power the NCPG and the Gunners wage a long war and Quincy is eventually retaken by The Minutemen The Gunners end up being a shadow of the former selves and are faded from memory while taking various low paying jobs 8 Although trapped on the roof of a tall Skyscraper Ironsides remained hopeful he and was eventually able to start up the boosters once again only for them to dislodge from the ship and take out two surrounding buildings Remaining hopeful Ironsides only claimed that this was just another setback 9 Brian Virgil continued his work on his FEV Cure and through many trials and errors his formula was mostly generalized In the dead of night and hidden from sight Virgil would load his cure in a Syringer and shoot Brahmin with it to help his cure spread faster in the Wasteland He only prayed that this would make up for his past work in the Institute s FEV Labs 10 Codsworth continued to proudly serve his master until they passed away in their sleep at an old age He mourned for a time and then began to serve Synth Shaun who mainly requested Codworth to collect parts for him which he happily obliged Codsworth would soon learn even he wasn t safe from the eccentric Synth Child s need to upgrade things and some some Wastelanders now speak of a Robot with Giddyup Buttercup Heads as eyes Despite this Codworth was happy to serve and though he didn t really mean it he told Synth Shaun that he liked his upgrades 11 With his son cured of his disease MacCready refunds the Caps the Sole Survivor had paid him and they part ways returning to the Capital Wasteland to once again take Mercenary work the only life he knows 12 Paladin Danse would eventually return to the Boston Airport knowing what had happened and who was responsible He mourned the deaths of his former friends and wandered into the wastes never to be seen again 13 Preston Garvey proudly served The Minutemen for the rest of his life He was always ready to help someone in need at a minute s notice 14 Piper had a lot of fun telling people I told you so after she was proven right about McDonough being a Synth She continued watching over Nat writing her Paper and making decisions on the City Council 15 With the death of Eddie Winter Nick was finally able to find peace with himself finally avenging the Nick Valentine that died so long ago His Detective Agency remained open taking one case at a time 16 X6 88 became troubled over the loss of The Institute and while he attempted to settle into a new life he was unable to cope with what had happened to The Institute One day the burden became too much for him and he took up his Laser Rife and went on a suicide mission to kill the one who ruined his life and in his words doomed humanity forever Father s Father made short work of X6 s attempts at vengeance and he is now buried in an unmarked grave behind one of the old Sanctuary Houses 17 Hancock continued his life as Mayor of Goodneighbor while helping out the weak While never officially joining The Minutemen he became a good friend and ally to them Anyone in Goodneighbor caught picking on the weak and defenseless would always wind up dead in a dumpster 18 Curie continued her research and with her new Synth Body and Mind the sky was the limit She would go on to publish many books of many subjects ranging from Science Medicine and everything else she could think of Her books became immensely popular and would be considered superior to The Wasteland Survival Guide 19 Deacon was happy to know the oppression of Synths was finally over and like many times before changed his face and identity becoming a spy for hire 20 A loyal Hound to the end Dogmeat remained at the Sole Survivor s side until he became a very old dog When he passed his grave was located at the place he and his master had met the Red Rocket Station near Sanctuary 21 Finally understanding the Milk of Human Kindness Strong attempted to sway his brethren to follow in his footsteps This would often end up with Strong killing the other Super Mutants in blind rage after they made fun of him Not wanting to be weak Strong still continued to try to teach his brethren about the Milk of Human Kindness with little to no success 22 Being freed from Parsons State Asylum Lorenzo Cabot would return to Rub al Khali and would eventually uncover every secret the City had to offer After Fallout 4 A personal headcanon Minutemen Ending,1127,5095,6221

Fallout,Hello all I ve once again picked up the controller and dove head first into New Vegas last week and now this weekend with F4 and am completely obsessed with the lore of the wastelands what came after and what came before Well sadly to say I never beat 3 and never picked up on anything they ever said about the Capitol How many bombs fell How different is the Capitol Wasteland from the other two Is it more of an everyday struggle for them to live in one wasteland over the other say IF this were to be reality And I suppose my that question can go vice versa with The Common Wealth and Mojave I m sorry if this is a stupid question I just know there are a lot more people who smartly payed attention to terminals and what NPCs have said about the different wastelands If you all would like you can add in who controlled and contested each wasteland at one point in time also to keep me from making another thread of a question similar to what I just asked Hello Vault Dwellers Ghouls Raiders and Survivors alike Can you all explain to me the historical differences of The Capitol Wasteland The Mojave and The Commonwealth,212,912,1123

Fallout,I really would like for someone to explain it to me because I am dumbfounded Please walk me through your thought process I started playing Fallout 4 about a week ago and its no less on an RPG than Fallout 3 or Fallout NV Am I seeing something that you aren t What makes Fallout 4 more of a first person shooter than an RPG Is it because you think RPG games can t have good graphics I am really confused Why do people say Fallout 4 is not as much of an RPG as other Fallout games,98,381,478
Fallout,There are many nukes in the fallout games that haven t even gotten out of their silos and are still able to launch not to mention some of the vaults i think had zero occupants or less than what was planned that s my theory what s yours I think that China or some other power that isn t the us started the great war,65,250,314
Fallout,I m playing Fallout 4 for the first time basically I m just trying to figure out whether or not doing the quest line for any of the factions will affect the progression or standing with any of the other factions Like if I m doing the BOS missions will any of those ruin my progression or standing with the Railroad or Minutemen Vice versa Fallout 4 Do any of the factions quest affect any of the other factions progression No spoilers please,83,359,441

Fallout,Which part of the fallout timeline would you like to set the next fallout Not what location as that is asked all the time I have two that I love would to see in future games The first is directly after the Great War We know it was possible to save during that time from 76 and it would be interesting see how the prewar society fell into chaos Would likely have to add a new roster of creatures to the game because the staple ones would be extremely rarely or haven t been created yet in the timeline Second would be a game post 3 4 The ending of 3 would lead to the wasteland getting a little more stable around DC and we could see more groups trying to do more than just survive like we see more on the west coast titles The Bethesda titles need more factions that have actual thought put into them and this setting would give them a great reason to But let me know your ideas I would love to hear them When to set the next fallout game,187,752,938
Fallout,If I get a mod like Survival Options can I set a level playing field I want to be able to one shot humans but also have them be able to one shot me Similar to DayZ or ARMA or something Would this be achievable by setting enemy damage player damage both to 2 3X FO4 survival mode damage question,60,235,294

Fallout,I ve been playing through the entire series for the past few weeks and I was really taken aback by the complete lack of the Enclave in Fallout 4 Like there s absolutely NOTHING Not even a verbal mention I know that after the events of 3 the East Coast branch of the Enclave was pretty much destroyed but surely some soldiers would ve been able to survive right In fact there s multiple Enclave veterans in New Vegas who were related to those on the oil rig from Fallout 2 Obviously D C is pretty far away from Boston but I m sure some of them would ve been able to make it there Can anyone help me out My lore knowledge is pretty rusty but I m really curious about this No remnants of the Enclave in FO4,140,564,703

Fallout,MINOR SPOILERS FOR 3 NV AND 4 but frankly if you haven t played them by now it s your fault Also this post isn t to take away from your opinion on how you want your next Fallout game This is just so people can get an idea of how bad writing can make good writing seem like other things I ve seen it on a lot of fallout threads that factions in Fallout 4 were bad and that a lot of people preferred FNV over other games in part because the major factions were not good or bad But all kind of morally darker gray I m here to say that the factions weren t better because they were gray they were better because they were better written and more fleshed out FO3 has this same issue while some people like it more it s generally agreed that the main story is kind of Boring It s not much of a choice Save everyone or kill everyone FNV was written very well The NCR were very clearly closer to a lighter gray but we re often morally objectionable Levying high taxes on poor towns acting as saviors when it was the Courier who did the saying trying to take power and water for themselves at others expense etc Then the legion were very clearly on the bad side but weren t always just evil Their leader was smart he knew rebuilding the old west wouldn t work and that people needed order He honestly wanted to help and you could tell that even if his actions of slavery and crucifixion are deplorable Then the others were gray and when you realized there were no objectively good choices you could fall back to YesMan Like I accidently did my first time In 4 the Railroad and Minute Men were so obviously good that they were one dimensional This could have been fine if the storyline wasnt so bland and the other factions made up for it But it wasn t and they didn t Then the institute is very clearly the more bad faction They stole people and didn t consider conscious sentient beings alive BUT Bethesda tried to make you feel like maybe they weren t so bad because they had technology and your son running the place Then the BOS was also more bad but not really bad Yes they hated non ferals and synths but you never got the feeling they were one step away from holocausting the commonwealth or one step towards being convinced to save everyone They were very standalone but not enough that it felt like they were a good fallback In NV the writers brought everyone down a moral peg and combined that with good writing to make them feel authentic In 4 they seemed to try to bring everyone up a bit Combine a new bright color palette with bright eyed factions instead of surviving warring factions Even in 3 the writing was good Yes they were one dimensional but they had a reason to be It was literally life or death for the Capitol Each vying for life These other games have made a lot of people think they want morally gray factions that are realistic about life in Fallout I e look out for yourself and fuck everyone else But that s the wrong connection Having a game like that isn t pleasant to play unless it s the punch in the gut during the last mission similar to Shadow of the Colossus But Fallout isn t that type of game No one plays fallout to have it feel sour constantly Your actions have consequences and not everything will likely be okay NV did this but it was mission to mission You rescued Primm but the radio after makes it sound like a dictator just moved in Sour You moved the Powder Gang out of Good springs and saved what s his nuts Not sour Then at the end you can get a good ending it s not all good but that s what makes it fun You can go back and try again because it might be good but it might not be the best The other games made you feel like you d won if you sided with the good guys and lost with the bad guys whereas NV made you feel like you d won no matter what Now all this sounds like I m contradicting myself but I m not Fallout NV and 3 but less so made the bad guys feel real and honest not just plain evil or boring And the good guys still wanted to help even if they weren t always perfect THAT DOESN T MEAN THEY HAVE TO BE TWO SIDES OF A DARK SHI Y COIN Plenty of wonderful fun games have BBEGs make good points and have the good guys do some shitty things And some even have a clear line between the two but it s still fun and immersive So no you don t want factions dark gritty edgy and morally objectionable You want them written well so you can get invested into their cause and feel like they re real No you don t want factions to be morally darker gray you just want them better written,892,3638,4529
Fallout,Where and when would you like Fallout 5 to take place Personally I don t want to go much further than 4 has considering that Fallout is starting to get to that rebuilding phase and less Post Apocalypse I d like to maybe see a game set sometime within the range of 1 3 and take place up near the great lakes regions There were plenty of cities that were on the up and up in the 50 s namely Detroit Cleveland and Columbus and each of these cities have rich histories I think you could make for some really compelling games If they were to do something like Detroit you could do some unique story lines what with Canada being across the lake there What do you guys think Where and when would you like Fallout 5 to take place,141,581,721

Fallout,It seems to be rather unpopular on this sub but I love it I haven t played Fallout 1 2 but from the modern Fallouts I prefer 4 I liked the more colorful artstyle it made exploring more fun 3 and NV look too dark brown in comparison The voiced protagonist made me more invested in the story and every conversation since the MC wasn t just a mute in the background while others talked The companions were the best of the series especially Nick is awesome The combat was also way better here than in the others The story was better in NV but I think Fallout 4 did the personal family angle better than Fallout 3 at least Fallout 4 is my favourite Fallout game,127,530,656

Fallout,I know that Bethesda is busy with Fallout 5 along with Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield plus they re stilling updating Fallout 76 so the chance of another spinoff game coming anytime soon is slim That doesn t stop us fans from discussing ideas of possible spinoffs however One idea that s being bouncing around in my head for the past few days is a pre war action game set in China where you are a US soldier or secret agent set ahead of the main invasion force Your mission to disable China s first strike capabilities and nuclear arsenal This could be a Metal Gear esque stealth game or it could be just a straight up action shooter This could be play out where you fail to complete your mission and you have a front row seat to TEOTWAKI as Chinese missiles are launched or it could end up as an alternate universe thing where you complete your mission and the ending cutscene has US Soldiers marching down a Beijing street with Liberty Prime leading the way And flying above the Great Hall of the People is the Star Spangled Banner Ideas for Fallout spinoffs,196,863,1058

Fallout,What kind of changes you would make Let s pretend that you are a superior modder or a dev and wish to expand the main story and it s ending with more choices and functions What kind of options would you put in Here are mine Institute surrender all faction except institute at the end when you reach the generator the Institute would offer surrender Spare them and their technology and they will be under your service and supervision Different faction leaders require different charisma check to accept it Preston wouldn t need any because you are the boss Desdemona would require a large one because she absolutely hates the Institute and has little care for their technology Maxxon would require medium While he also despise the Institute he does not deny that their technology is impressive and useful Railroad alternative takeover this one would require some convincing but you could give an alternative path for the Railroad to take over the Institute With much less bloodshed What you need is to sneak and hack into the Synth Retention Bureau s office and find the shutdown codes for the Institute s defenses Then you need to convince everyone to leave the teleporter and bring the Railroad agents in Then you go to the Director s office and send out the shutdown signal and order everyone to let the Railroad take over The RR goes in and with the defenses down almost all members of the Institute surrenders without fight You get informed that a several scientists went back to the reactor room and must pursue before they do something stupid In the reactor room they threaten you with blowing up everything if you and the RR don t leave forever You have 5 option there 1 Before the dialogue happens you could use stealth boy to sneak in and sabotage the controls Preventing the ability to give the command 2 You could use a very high charisma check to have them stand down 3 Speaking with Tinker Tom would reveal that he has a stealth boy and if you distract them then he can sabotage the controls for you Need low charisma check for the distraction dialogues 4 Speaking with Desdemona would offer to take reverse roles She makes a distraction while you sneak for the controls Reduce perception of enemies during the talking She would also give you a stealth boy 5 You can fight without sabotage You get exactly 1 second before the guy at the controls press the button and game over So you need to be very fast use vats or start killing that guy instead of the dialogue Also during the dialogue you would have an option to shoot that person straight away Be warned that if not sabotaged then multiple NPC would be scripted to run there and press the button YOU MUST NOT ALLOW THEM Kellog s deal During your encounter with Kellog you could make a deal He brings you into the Institute and you help him with Virgil He becomes a temporary companion Once Virgil down he honor his end of the deal and gives you his device with the courser chip and gives the command of his recall You enter the Institute instead of him and stuff gets revealed You never meet Kellog again Later you can learn that he left the Commonwealth Probably for good If you could alter F4 s main story as you see fit,578,2613,3190
Fallout,Since Fallout 1 there has never been a connected story or a sequel from one game to another Just a different location and a couple of references to the previous fallout games So this may be a pipe dream of mine I d imagine a Commonwealth set 60 70 years after the destruction of the Institute and the Invasion of Splinter Cell Group of the Brotherhood Of Steel Like the Outcasts The Sole Survivor who sided with the Minutemen rebuilt the City Boston where Diamond City is really the Jewel Of the Commonwealth the hub for Science and Technology as the Remnants of the Institute ran here and became pioneers for research and technology Goodneighbour which is still a sanctuary for the Ghouls and the underbelly of society and surrounding Massachusetts is littered with Minutemen settlements and Raiders Super Mutants and Ghouls have been relatively cleansed The Railroad is still underground helping the remaining Synths on the run and working with them The Brotherhood who maintains a small Garrison Embassy at the Airport still gathers prewar tech in the Glowing Sea and is in amicable relations with the Minutemen Everything is well until the Death of Elder Maxson Civil War entails following his death and a group known as the BOS Outcasts had taken over the Outcasts who continue to uphold the Brotherhood s mission and scour the Wasteland reclaiming pre War sites in search of valuable technology And that includes the Commonwealth Despite the Minutemen now in control of the majority of the Commonwealth They deem the Minutemen in the way of their mission and proceed to invade the territory of the Minutemen causing death and destruction for the sake of their mission The Commonwealth is now in ruins with Raiders Super Mutants and Outcasts in charge of the New Wasteland where homelessness poverty and starvation are now commonplace Fallout 5 is set after the destruction of the Minutemen instead of a Vault Dweller stuck out of time players will be in control of a scarred young adult who grew in a peaceful settlement and saw the destruction of it Perhaps in Sanctuary and watched her his parents die protecting it then a war torn Boston as an orphan and later a scavver The Player can side with either the Outcasts Raiders help the Minutemen Resistance retake Boston or with the Railroad Nick may still be found with the Railroad hiding in an undisclosed location Strong may have found riding with another Super Mutant Gang MacCready Cait Piper and other human followers in Fallout 4 are either dead or old New followers such as Dogmeat or the railroad Outcasts Raiders may appear and old companions like Hancock or X6 88 may still be found Preston Garvey and the Sole Survivor died fighting in the final Stand at the Castle This is all really just a shower thought or something I think of when I go to sleep and is really all just a pipedream But one can dream P S this is my first post in r Fallout I apologise If i didn t use the Flair right or did something wrong Just wanted to share my dream for the next Fallout p Fallout 5 A sequel to Fallout 4,541,2522,3062

Fallout,This is just my personal headcanon of what happened after the events of Fallout 3 1 The Lone Wanderer largely disappears from public eye with rumors circulating that they headed West headed to The Commonwealth returned to Vault 101 retired to Megaton and some even say they re flying a UFO throughout space 2 Popularized by Three Dog the Lone Wanderer becomes a folk hero in the Capital Wasteland with many people creating and sharing stories about the figure with most being popular with Wasteland Children with some drawing a big 101 on their backs to emulate their hero 3 Three Dog begins to air a Radio Play based on the Lone Wanderer similar to the Herbert Daring Dashwood Plays with HDD himself playing the role of James though he d rather play the Lone Wanderer 4 With Harold s Heart accelerated lush green plants begin appearing in the Wasteland within a few short years 5 Thanks to Project Purity Rivet City expands and becomes a powerful Settlement in the Wasteland 6 Overseer Amata opens the Vault and begins trading with outsiders They eventually expand into the nearby Springvale and develop friendly trading relationships with Megaton and Big Town 7 Members of the Enclave who weren t at the destruction of Raven Rock and Adams Air Force Base left their old lives behind and resettled into new ones missing the old days in Raven Rock and the Enclave who once terrorized the Wasteland became a distant memory 8 Paradise Falls is sacked by an unknown person and ironically is eventually transformed into a safe haven for escaped Slaves to rest and resupply while on their way to the Lincoln Memorial 9 Big Town does expand a little bit and still accepts former Little Lamplighters to this day After Fallout 3 my personal headcanon,303,1440,1742
Fallout,Reading through the wiki if you recruit Madison Li to the BoS then when you destroy the institute she is upset at the BoS because she feels betrayed If you beat the game as the Minutemen instead so the BoS never attacks the institute will she still be upset I ve never tested this Fallout 4 Madison Li opinion of you Spoilers,62,264,325

Fallout,Now this character is more of an East Coast character this is kind of like a Fallout OC His name is sentinel Abraham and he is an ex brotherhood of steel member Back in the events of Fallout 3 he would fight the mutants and protect the people of the Commonwealth but when Sarah and elder Lions both died And Arthur maxson took control it went back to the old brotherhood way Abraham left Cuz he knew what was right saving the people not from the technologies but from the mutants I don t know if I m allowed to post this year so I m sorry if it s not allowed I created my own Fallout character,118,476,593
Fallout,Fallout 3 will always and forever be my favorite It s a very close match with New Vegas but something about Fo3 makes me feel at home In a post apocalyptic sort of way The story is so well planned and very well executed and that final battle with Liberty Prime and Sarah Lyons was one of my favorite moments in playing any Fallout game I love how your character isn t a nobody and has a fleshed our backstory with a father and friends and enemies I really love the interactions you can have with characters and the writers did a really great job with the dialogue Why I love Fallout 3 spoilers,114,480,593
Fallout,Hello all I recently decided to reinstall fallout 3 on my windows 10 pc Got the game running after jumping through a few hoops It runs well but occasionally the game completely freezes and im forced to use windows task manager to close it I was wondering if there is anything I can do or anything I can install to make it run better I currently don t have mods installed not even the unofficial patch I ve run into a lot of issues using mods with this particular game and im not interested in using a tale of two wastelands Fallout 3 freezing Fo3,105,442,546

Fallout,So if you ve gambled up the casino and ran out of chips so you can t buy anymore stimpacks always stock up on cartons of cigarettes and pre war clothing along with scrap metal and fission batteries 2 pieces of scrap metal and a fission battery can be crafted into 50 chips Pre war clothing is very common and can be sold by almost every vender in the game and give you roughly 2 5 chips per clothing Cartons of cigarettes give you 20 chips per carton I saved up 46 fission batters and scrap metal along with 30 cartons of cigarettes and returned it all into the vending machine and ended up with over 10k chips Plus the mini safe in the bunker restocks Those who have run out of Sierra Madre chips and need more to get stimpacks and stuff like that I have a suggestion for you,151,626,776

Fallout,I got this glitch Icon pc png Icon ps4 png After killing Kendra and optionally Shelly one will be tasked with listening to Silver Shroud Radio for an update It s possible that this update won t actually play and the quest will be perpetually stuck Use the console command setstage MS04 600 to advance to the stage immediately after hearing the broadcast which is to meet with Hancock verified The problem is i have no idea how to use console commands on the xbox series s and was wondering if anyone had another fix for it Its not even the quest so much as i just want the xp for the time i put in and my last save is too far back Silver Shroud glitch,127,525,651
Fallout,No matter what s in it no matter what it s like I just want some official live action fallout There s so much lore that I d be happy with any of it ending up on screen A movie a tv show etc anything would satisfy me and yet they haven t done any of it so far The amazon series that s in development is one of my most anticipated things at the moment even though it could take years to come out I just want some more fallout man I legitimately can t fucking wait for some official live action fallout content,105,403,507

Fallout,I have found myself loving fallout 4 its my first bethesda game and the only one I play Although when I went to use mods the mod desperado fallout4NV landscape retexture mod it took up 55 of the limit this did not give me enough room to make the game fun What I m asking is with the new Xbox series X will they extend the 2GB fallout 4 getting an update,72,282,353
Fallout,No game so far has been unanimously received as perfect and none ever will but what are the best qualities of each game that could be mixed to make as close to the perfect game as possible Things like weapon mechanics VATS mechanics acting combat role playing elements armour mechanics power armour enemies setting story factions etc What would a perfect Fallout game look like,65,313,377

Fallout,I think they should make 2 versions Xbox one Xbox series x and the series x has 4k 60fps raytracing option setting and they extend the 2GB limit thats all were asking for even with just 5GB that s all we really need because with the standard 2GB its not working the other day I wanted to make a new vegas playthrough and I was excited but the desperado fallout NV landscape retexture takes 55 of the storage and the Weapon mods are like 100MB each Fallout 4 extend 2gb,90,379,468
Fallout,I loved fallout but something that s bothered me about the series since fallout 3 is the damn accuracy of laser weapons They are literal beam weapons that just fire in whatever direction I would love if they had pinpoint accuracy even if it meant reducing their damage or firerate Can someone explain to me why the fuck are Fallout lasers so inaccurate,63,290,352

Fallout,I just finished honest hearts what dlc should I play next story wise Fallout new Vegas dlc,17,74,90
Fallout,I loved New Vegas but FO3 has always been my favorite one so I usually played that more even after FO4 With that I had totally forgot the traits in New Vegas give you bonus but at the cost of other things At character creation I ended up just choosing the Wild Wasteland and the melee perk because everything else the benefit did not outweigh the loss at least in my own opinion and I never really use melee in FO so there was no loss on important skills or attributes haha I did think about going with Skilled and Wild but then I found out that Skilled doesn t just decrease xp gain it also gives you less perks which is not worth 5 points in every skill Anyway what traits did everyone else like picking at CC It has been so long since I played New Vegas,149,608,756
Fallout,So exactly one year ago I was shuffling through the Appalachian wasteland I was around Lvl 45 Couldn t carry any good legendaries I d about ground the game to the point where it wasn t fun any more I was thinking about quitting Imagine a sad lonely fallout player character shuffling in the rain waiting for events And that was me When an event popped I fast traveled Loaded up what was left of my gear And was ready to just exist in the background and rack up XP One thing was different about this event A few of the players had area chat going and where communicating One of them called me over for help and I snapped to Jumping in to the heart of the action aside them One of the players was Lvl 250 give or take so an absolute unit It was this lady She was blanketing the area in fire and felling enemies left and right It was glorious I didn t feel useless either She gave me some ammo when I ran out And encouraged me to get in there I think it was a queen fight So it was invigorating to finally have someone calling out legendary enemies when they spawned And even let me score hits to get legendary gear Later that day she have me loads of medical items food recipes plans ammo and a ton of materials After which we kinda just hung out Next thing you know she asks How old do y all think I am It was me and some other dude I ain t seen since then He answered 20 s I answered 30 s She got a really good chuckle out of the first answer Then rolls off with I m 60 The other anon guy is flabbergasted Me knowing about Shirley Curry kinda didn t question it They guy loses his fucking mind Not in a bad way But to an almost weird extent He just couldn t grasp that someone her age had the time or patience to sit and play 76 for that long He disappeared And I ended up playing with her more often She even handed me my first Lvl 50 legendary It was alike that kid opening his Red Ryder BB gun in that movie I can t remember right now but everyone knows It s been a year And a tribe has formed around this lady In fact a lot of ladies older than me make up the bulk of our tribe She s become the defacto matriarch And is a mainstay in the game Whenever she s on I don t feel alone while playing Ever since she s helped me put ammo down range chems in my inventory and resources in my scrap box for building I ve levelled all the way to 222 She just hit level 770 Around there She s a tough one in real life too The pandemic reared its ugly head And she came down with coronavirus And ya know what happened Like making a deathclaw eat a mini nuke SHE BEAT THE FUCK OUT OF THE RONA She s still kicking around being the sweetest Fallout grandma Handing out ammo and chems She ll even talk you up when you re feeling down Fallout 76 is still not perfect A couple things I still don t like about it and how bethesda chooses to run it But what makes it perfect enough for me to log on and play for a while Is a literal fallout family That I can talk to and hang out with That s an experience I can t get in the mojave the capitol or the commonwealth Cass is the queen of cool But she want help you feel better when life kicks the fuck out of you A Wholesome Fallout 76 Xbox Story,650,2527,3176

Fallout,Hey everyone I would like to introduce my boyfriend to the Fallout series but I don t know how to really explain it to him Can somebody help me Thanks in advance A quick summarized introduction to the Fallout series,40,176,215
Fallout,I for one think the game should work like a tabletop game in this regard In my opinion You should never be allowed to max out every skill and stat You should be choosing your skills based on what type of character your want to play as Stealth Science Combat Diplomacy etc and while you should be able to do whatever you want You shouldn t be able to make the best easiest decisions every single time regardless of play style I guess in theory you don t need a level cap to do this But regardless I think it should be impossible to come anywhere close to having max stats There should be something preventing you from acquiring all skills and stats and perks I think that the perk tree system that action games typically use ones that have you play as a set character but overtime you unlock all of their abilities Is fun but takes away from the role playing aspects of Fallout and Elderscrolls and ultimately make most characters and play throughs feel the same Of the most recent systems used in their games Skill System New Vegas Perk System Fallout 4 Cards System 76 Experience based system Skyrim I personally find them all lacking But I also believe they re lacking because developers aren t willing to force players to specialize New Vegas has the closest to my ideal system It has traits skill checks and challenges but speech is still op charisma is a dump stat and there s not much weapon specialization outside of perks Atom RPG actually addresses these issues by dividing up the weapons skills further Shot guns and rifles Pistols and SMGs Automatic Weapons Explosives Throwing Melee Martial Arts And it makes Charisma affect who is willing to talk to you outside of your speech skill So it isn t a dump stat Your character can be really convincing but it won t help much if your attitude and appearance turn people off from interacting with you to begin with There s also a perk you can acquire by reading a book that teaches you street slang So your character can prove to shadier characters that they re in the know But it lacks challenges and then again I don t know how well that stuff would transfer into a first person game Even Outerworlds which while I love that they divided up the speech system is held back by the simple fact that it s too generous to the player and allows them to specialize in too much And how do you handle the gun problem In my opinion weapons that the player isn t good with should have more sway like Fallout 3 Then as you specialize the sway is reduced but I can also see that being frustrating early on Skyrim is the most immersive but it can also be incredibly tedious and lacks anything to prevent the player from mastering every skill and allowing them to choose any path at any time regardless of their play style Which I think cheapens the game You aren t role playing anymore You aren t forced into uncomfortable situations You re just choosing the best option from a list So do you prefer more action rpg elements or RPG Specialization elements Level cap or no Level Cap Mechanic preference Level Caps Skill systems Immersion and Role Playing What s important to you,573,2549,3121

Fallout,Hello My name is Cristian I have played and thoroughly enjoyed both the Fallout and Elder Scrolls series since 2008 This morning my grandfather passed away from natural causes He was a music teacher rancher and veterans advocate for all of his life He was a pillar of the community here in Laredo TX He was born on a small ranch in South Texas in 1927 and while he never showed much interest in video games I know that this morning he received the good karma ending The reason that I am writing this is because I would like to request that my grandfather Elmo Lopez might be honored in the next Fallout game in some way if possible He played the trumpet his entire life and his love of 1950 s musicians like Frank Sinatra Louis Armstrong and Bing Crosby are what allowed me to connect with the Fallout series in a more deep and meaningful way I know in my heart that being associated with great musicians like these in a Fallout game would bring him great joy The Fallout series has always made great strides in creative innovation and introduced an entire generation of men and women to the joys of music that they might not have listened to otherwise My grandfather would be elated to be involved in even a very small way in a series that has accomplished this so effectively Thank you for reading this and may God bless every one of you GetElmoinFallout,250,1107,1356

Fallout,Obviously Fallout 4 takes heavy inspiration from Blade Runner with synths taking the place of replicants and the main story of FO4 explores a lot of the same philosophical ideas I recently watched Blade Runner for the first time and aside from the main theme of the stories I noticed a lot of smaller references and easter eggs that have previously gone over my head Covenant s SAFE test is a reference to FO3 s GOAT but it s also a reference to the Voight Kompff test used in Blade Runner to distinguish humans from replicants Takahashi s noodle stand is a reference to the noodle bar Deckhard eats at in the beginning of Blade Runner Takahashi uses the same greeting as the man in the movie The Courser uniform looks a lot like Roy Batty s jacket Like a courser Roy Batty is a military model replicant with enhanced combat abilities Tyrell is the CEO of the corporation which makes replicants Roy Batty cally Tyrell Father in their climactic confrontation which is likely the inspiration for synths calling Shaun Father in the Institute In a theater in FO4 s downtown Boston there are a pack of mannequins on stage with one synth hiding among them to ambush you a reference to the replicant ambushing Deckard at the beginning of the final fight On the roof of Mass Fusion containment there s a kneeling synth next to a human body reenacting the final conversation between Batty and Deckard Are there any more I missed Blade Runner 1982 easter eggs in Fallout 4 major spoilers for both,266,1221,1486

Fallout,I m watching Many A True Nerd s Fallout 4 YOLO One thing that struck me is how much more stressful the run would be if you couldn t tell who was a raider trader or Gunner Imagine seeing a figure far off in the distance and not knowing who they are You re a while away from a settlement and you need to be supplied You could approach them and risk combat you could attack first and ask questions later or you could keep moving on This is why I love the Rust and Dust mods It ramps up the paranoia and fear of FO3 Fallout would be a completely different game if no one was labeled,118,461,578

Fallout,I m sorry about the clickbaity title but I mean it why doesn t the master consider using human livestock to breed potential mutants For those who haven t played the game in fallout 1 you can persuade the master to kill himself because mutants can t breed and therefore his plan to replace humans with mutants would put a clock on the extinction of mutantkind This makes sense at first glance until you realise that mutans being able to breed is irrelevant to his plan simply keep a group minimally irradiated but unworthy humans to breed and provide you with a steady supply of vat fodder This idea came to my mind the first time I played fallout 1 and I assume it must have crossed the mind of at least 1 of the developers and certainly the master would be able to consider it I think having to persuade the master that slavery would taint his dreams of peace or that by relying on humans mutants would never be able to escape the failings of human society or anything other than mutants can t breed guess I ll develop depression and kill myself would have made the ending to fallout 1 just that bit more believable I m aware I m bitching about a minor detail in 30 year old game but it s something that s bugged me for a few years and now hopefully it can bug some of you too Why doesn t The Master consider sex slaves,253,1068,1320
Fallout,Two things are certain the most endorsed and downloaded will be made within 24months of a games release date The other certaintly is that stuff made in that timeframe will seem shoddy compared to what is available years later when the people know the game a lot better and have several other third party applications created specifically to enable more modding potential I think there should be a time limited window that can not be exceeded but I m just not sure what would be a good one 2 weeks A month A year Maybe nexus having the option to filter mods by most downloaded endorsed of all time is a mistake and should not be a thing,118,518,635
Fallout,It doesn t have to be super underrated so long as it really improves the game for you No need to link them but specifying where they can be found Nexus Steam Workshop etc might be handy Here s a few that come to mind for me all from the Nexus FNV Sit anywhere mod Let s you sit down on the ground wherever you may be A World of Pain Very famous but still the best mod I ve seen in the last 20 years and believe me I ve seen them all Gives Fallout as many hidden locations to explore as skyrim except every one is handcrafted and unique with its own story to tell Dog City Denver Visit Denver as it was before the war a giant pile of rubble dogs and vagrants Good voice acting great world building one very very dangerous police station FO4 More Guards mods exterior Diamond city defences Theres four different ones but they increase the guards number quality of guards and turrets around Diamond City Hancock s Hellhole and Bunker Hill No longer will a raider veteran or deathclaw single handedly take out NPC s all the defences of the last bastion of civilization Travelling NPCs groups of friendly non friendly humans animals robots etc travel along roads and through the countryside while checking out stops along the way Very customizable and really brings the world to life Nest Shelters adds little shelters all over the wasteland from tiny to rather sizable Each is hand designed and you can tell the creator tried to give each one its own little story Sadly there no AWOP for Fallout 4 but his is kind of like AWOP lite Also helps fill in the map with fast travel points Whats an underrated or niche mod for FO4 or NV you think more people should know about,312,1354,1665
Fallout,There s a random encounter in Fallout 4 when you come across two characters called Art each stating they are real life Art and the other is a synth I ve played this game on and off for the past 5 years now Several play throughs Experienced this random encounter several times and it has just dawned on me that the whole thing is a nod to the idea that Life Imitates Art only this time it is Artificial Life Imitating Art Mind Blown Can t believe I m still noticing things like this FUN SIDENOTE When this random encounter started I was in Bunker Hill and walked past Art who said can t believe that thing had my face Realised who he was and thought I must have missed the encounter and it was after the event Carried on to the market to sell my wares when all of a sudden gunfire Thought it must have been some raiders attacking the Hill but instead it was Art and Art STILL fighting right in the middle of Bunker Hill It was funny watching them have quite an epic fight as it was in Bunker Hill there was a lot of cover so it lasted like 5 minutes and no one react or care to any of it It was only when I was explaining to my wife that it had bugged out and how it normally plays out that the penny dropped about life imitating art Life Imitating Art,249,1003,1251

Fallout,It really bothers me that the world levels with you I feel like it takes away a lot of the challenges s ruins the immersion for the sake of not inconveniencing new players But I wouldn t really mind it if it were optional I don t know how this works in 76 I ve only played the story once and a bit of wastelanders I m not into it don t me I like coming across an area that requires special equipment or a high level of skill to overcome at a lower level It feels like I ve progressed I really liked that in New Vegas you couldn t just walk carelessly off the road at a low level I wish the road had been a bit less straight and mindless to follow but I loved that deathclaws required you to be careful of you went north I like that Cazadores ambush you I love that in Morrowind they tell you to take a break and get stronger before you move on to the next main quest I love that in Darksouls you can accidentally stumble into one of the most difficult areas of the game and get evicerated by unkillable enemies I get that for casual gamers this sort of stuff can be frustrating but I don t see why the more hardcore audience should have their experience watered down when there can be an easy comprise for this problem Just make it optional But if they can t do this then I still believe progressive leveling shouldn t be in Fallout 5 There shouldn t be Progressive Leveled Enemies or at the very least it should be optional,282,1143,1424

Fallout,So I had a crazy idea for the next fallout game The player was supposed to be either the vault s head of security medical staff or maintenance utilities depending on the character s SPECIALs basically head of any vault staff department not the overseer to allow the player more RP freedom Now leading up to the bombs there was no practice evacs drills or any preparation work nor were you ever allowed to actually see the vault So the day the bombs drop you all rush to the location where the vault is supposed to be just to find out it doesnt exist A few of you survived at first but people would begin succumbing to radiation poisoning in the weeks to come Eventually you decide to leave whatever makeshift shelter you and your fellow dwellers managed to assemble You could find a nearby notebook or terminal or something with like the overseer s journal talking about how he thought it was odd that there wasn t any preparation or drills and it was making him rather nervous etc spoiler Turns out the whole thing was a Vault Tec experiment to see how people would react with little to no advance notice without any shelter in a nuclear fallout spoiler Fallout UNDEFINED,213,960,1172

Fallout,I m thinking about getting 76 I loved 3 and 4 couldn t get into New Vegas though Appalachia is the closest the games have gotten to my home state but still radically different I ve also been listening to the Appalachia Radio on YouTube and it s soundtrack pretty sweet So far the only dealbreaker will be how the multiplayer works Will it be like ESO where I can just ignore most of not all players or maybe more like Rust or Ark where I can be sniped from a tree just because I didn t watch my back while gathering items Can I solo Fallout 76 like ESO,110,443,552

Fallout,Because my unhealthy obsession with the series can t possibly be a problem if I end up making something out of it It s going to be scripted like a screenplay as I m hoping an animator might pick it up and actually put it to screen Some input from the community on the overall plot which characters to include would be more than helpful as well as motivating thus the reason why I m posting here instead of just writing the shitty fanfiction screenplay already So basically the idea is this Following the events of Fallout 4 I m open to suggestions as to which ending I should go with the Sole Survivor receives a transmission through the HAM radio in the Red Rocket settlement The transmission is patchy as though it s coming from somewhere far outside the Commonwealth Even more unusual is the transmission itself a distress call from what the survivor can gather with a set of coordinates attached Upon actually plugging in the coordinates the survivor realizes this transmission somehow managed to come from all the way across the Wasteland originating somewhere in the mountains of Northern California The Sole Survivor being the Sole Survivor feels obligated to go due in no small part to unrelenting boredom brought on by the monotony of helping settlements they really don t have much else to do now that the big players of the Commonwealth are either dead spoiler or peaceful spoiler However hauling one s ass across over one thousand miles of irradiated post apocalyptic Wasteland is easier said than done Luckily for them there s word of a caravan that s recently stopped outside Goodneighbor one claiming to have come from a place very near to where the Sole Survivor is headed So all one has to do is go over to Goodneighbor convince the leader of the caravan a mysterious man known only as Six to let you hop on maybe bring some friends along and overall have a fun time right Right As of yet I have no idea which characters to include in the party though there are some that I know I can t leave out Hancock Nick Valentine Strong Macready Paladin Danse and Cait to name a few Great characters stuck in a shit game all of whom could use some room to breathe and develop Along the way I m also hoping to bring in Arcade Gannon Charon and Rex However I don t just want to make this for my own satisfaction I want this to be something the community as a whole can enjoy which is why I am overall leaving which companions to take along and flesh out to you guys TLDR Any story companion plot or lore suggestions Please let me know Seriously I need input very badly I m scripting an unofficial Fallout series amp would like some input,484,2159,2642

Fallout,So whenever I play Fallout 4 now Cogsworth Preston amp Piper all act very oddly Cogsworth glitches out after his initial conversation after you escape vault 111 For some reason the speech check keeps popping up amp after I end dialogue he ll float into a wall instead of going after the bugs amp wont open dialogue again even after the bugs have been dealt with Preston will go through the plan in the museum of freedom but after the last line the camera stays in Dialogue mode until you cancel dialogue amp the mission wont update which means the other raiders amp the deathclaw never spawn which also means I can t continue with the minute men quest line Piper gets about half way through her interview then dialogue just ends amp I can t get her as a companion until after I kill Kellogg when you get to choose to go with her or nick So far that s what I ve noticed Anyone have any solutions FO4 Companions wont work right Anyone got a solution,178,770,947
Fallout,do What are the best mods for Xbox edition With no dlc required,13,51,63
Fallout,Definitely plan on getting New Vegas got 3 and 4 on my Xbox and ps4 not gon na buy both for a third time haha and also gon na get the first two games at some point as well My question is has anyone played tactics Is it like a tactics game like FF or is it a lot different I don t see a video on steam the screen shots looks more along the lines of a Baldur s Gate type of thing then an actual tactics type of game Also though I see it less on reddit then social media sites I could look it up on Google or watch it on YouTube would rather ask fans of the series who have played it So looking at these games on steam,133,483,615
Fallout,do Does anyone know what s in the root cellar in the Springdale house in Fallout 3,17,66,82
Fallout,DISCLAIMER THIS IS JUST AN OPINION I M NOT SAYING THAT NEW VEGAS IS OBJECTIVELY BAD I JUST HAD TO GET SOME COMPLAINTS OUT OF MY SYSTEM PLEASE DON T LEAVE COMMENTS ON THE LINES OF HA HA NOOB CAN T PLAY NEW VEGAS AS I HAD ALREADY BEATEN NEW VEGAS ON HARDCORE DIFFICULTY IN THE PAST IT S JUST THAT NOWADAYS I AM HAVING TROUBLE PLAYING THROUGH THE GAME WITHOUT DYING OF BOREDOM I used to play Fallout NV for hours a day during the summertime of my young teenage years and nowadays when I launch the game it feels like a chore Everything looks really bad because the graphics aged super badly The story feels uninteresting because to me it s nonsensical than in a country where barely cities have formed suddenly we have entire armies going to fight each other like in some sort of a Lord of the Rings movie Radiation is poorly described why is it green Why does it turn people into zombies And quests feel oddly unsatisfying Boone s quest is literally find a girl pickpocket her open a safe find note bring girl in front of dinosaurs head explodes The areas seem extremely unbalanced Most of the early game is filled with bandits that take one shot to kill pigrats radscorpions and then suddenly there is an area with two supermutants armed with late game weapons like the super sledge or a 5mm minigun There are Night Stalkers out of nowhere you can deal with those because they are squishy But for some reason the game throws at you 10 Ghoul Ravagers backed up by the Glowing Ones The Hardcore mode is just dumb it adds nothing to the game but causes you to waste time by looking for water and food and occasionally being forced to sleep And the Very Hard difficulty I chose to play on is unimmersive and makes enemies look ridiculously gimmicky With enemies taking a lot of shots from my Plasma Defender a mid game plasma pistol before dying It s also super hard to aim in this game as plasma missiles never go where you aim them and melee enemies have unimaginably high movement speed Aiming at them with VATS sure allows you to deal a lot of damage but it also allows them to catch up with you if they are Radscorpions for example although Radscoprions are not the problem The Ghoul Ravagers are Especially if they move in a ten unit group Also rewards for exploration feel meager The lake with the giant Radscorpions only offered a case of ammo The moon canyon filled with Golden Geckos I can t get the way how Sulik says Golden Geckos in Fallout 2 I m having vietnam flashbacks to that game just by saying Golden Geckos I got to that canyon and the only thing I got was an advanced radiation suit Like all I have to do is pop Rad X Who cares about the suit The Legion feels dumb How did this tribe of guys with swords manage to defeat NCR which has somehow figured out how to manufacture weapons And the final problem of all How do groups of raiders the size of 10 manage to feed themselves in a desert where their biggest hunt can be a caravan armed to the teeth that consists of a group of 3 They can t even rob any towns Because Goodsprings is in the middle of nowhere Novac is well protected And Well There aren t just that many random towns and villages to sustain a population of that size of roaming bandits This is always the problem for me in terms of RPG games There can be no bandits if the population is not big enough to hide them If there is literally just a single point of populous where bandits can come to rob someone then how the hell do they survive without being nailed down One of the powder gangers goes and says NCR is sure scary but this is a big desert they won t find us EXCUSE ME Your CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IS A 2 MINUTE WALK AWAY FROM THEIR NEAREST BASE LIKE I GET THAT THIS IS NOT REALISTIC DISTANCES BUT THE FURTHEST YOU ARE FROM THAT PLACE IS 3 HOURS OF WALKING NCR LITERALLY HAS TO JUST WALK OUTSIDE AND THE ONLY THING PROTECTING YOU IS THAT THEY DON T CARE I wish there was a dialogue option to tell that guy to stop acting like a freaking ding dong but this is another problem I have with Fallout New Vegas In Fallout 1 and 2 at least you had some unpredictable dialogue options The capitalist ghoul of Gecko talking about greed The Harold s weird story about exploring the Mariposa Military Base with his buds The Decker contract The cat story of the Den I m not some nostalgia fanboy don t get me wrong I ve forced myself to play these games a year ago and now that I m done and finally came back to semi modern times Cuz New Vegas is considered very old now I come to realize that even though those games were super clanky the dialogue over there was semi decent And now I m back at New Vegas where everything just feels generic and poorly told The way how Legion is introduced is just cheap You walk into a town and then there is an edgy guy with a wolf s hat talking to you about how you have witnessed their power good job you destroyed a town I have no idea what it was or who lived here This vile act has as much impact on me as you killing a dog on the other side of planet Earth Alright that s enough You get the jyst I m going to delete my save file and attempt to play the game without the dumbass Hardcore mode and on Normal difficulty so that I can focus on the narrative and perhaps enjoy the game but as it stands it feels like this game wants me to uninstall it and go outside But there is no outside Wth I used to love Fallout New Vegas Now I hate it What happened,1049,4372,5420
Fallout,I m very stuck at this Alright so I m trying to play honest hearts and I ve got the carry weight thing to 100 but I still have to travel alone But I don t know how to do that I m with arcade gannon and ED E I have no idea how to do this,57,180,236
Fallout,That mod limit on Xbox needs to be expanded soon I m sure we can afford to start over If not I ll tell Phil Spencer From Literally Everyone on Xbox Consoles A Plea from an annoyed Fan Dear Bethesda,40,158,197
Fallout,One thing I d like is them to change and implement karma I wasn t a huge fan of loosing karma for things the game encourages like pickpocketing I wan na see more weapons as I felt fallout 4 lacked a huge arsenal like new vagus had I wan na see them keep modding weapons and I really couldn t care less about in game mods I use nexus anyways I like the way fo4 made their dlcs being able to discover a brand new map AND being able to go in and out I didn t like how after the dlc with fo3 and new vagus there wasn t much to do there The main story of the dlc is done there isn t much to do there Fo4 did a great job on dlcs and in my opinion better than new vagus which is praised as having the best dlcs I d like to see the return of the minuteman I feel that they made a impression on me A big thing I want is more of a moral choice In fo3 it s clear the enclave is bad New vagus legion is bad Fo4 had a bit more morality in the main quest but it was still clear that the institute were the bad guys I get that all the factions in all the games had their flaws but it was just to easy to choose who to side with and I m telling you it wasn t the legion This plagues the Bethesda rpgs even Skyrim has this this problem Imperials bad stormcloak a good I hope that fo5 brings much more morality into the factions I want them to make all the factions have more of a feeling that gives the player a really hard choice I want each faction to be in a word nicer They should have more morals and be improving the people They should really feel like people That s why I love the minuteman they feel real They have their flaws everyone does Despite this they are a good faction with good people What do YOU wan na see in fo5,361,1355,1715

Fallout,Bethesda being bought by Microsoft is no longer news to anyone and is only reappearing due to the recent confirmation in Europe I believe However one thing I have noticed on social media lately are complaints from PS owners about the acquisition because they fear that some of their favorite titles will be Microsoft exclusives 1 It is ironic that PlayStation owners who s main argument is that PlayStation has better exclusives are now mad at the prospect of Xbox having good exclusives 2 It s a bit of an overreaction on their end because Microsoft has always been in the market of making money Why would they bother making Fallout or Elder Scrolls exclusives when they can sell to both systems and make even more money Overall I don t hate the move I m pretty ambivalent about it I would like to get everyone s take on their thoughts and what they ve seen people talk about Bethesda under Microsoft,162,740,901

Fallout,And he seems to be having a blast The last game he seriously played that I can recall was either Final Fantasy or Ocarina of Time both over 20 years ago He recently retired and had gotten an PS4 some time ago so my mom could play Tomb Raider and or watch Netflix though she never used it I had mentioned to my dad all of the XBONE games that I owned after noticing he had a PS4 and mentioned how Fallout 4 and Skyrim were pretty much must haves and were also the style of game he would enjoy Cue a few weeks or so later and I come over to find my dad seriously searching for mini nukes for his fat man and scavenging junk to get enough caps to buy a legendary weapon from KLE0 I ve been over to visit at least once every other week or so and each time he s got his 4k Television on and going away at Fallout 4 which is cool that I seemingly talked him into checking it out I did also mention that Fallout 4 takes place primarily in and around the greater Boston area and my dad is originally from Lowell so I think that may have piqued his interest I still ask if he has joined the correct faction yet Institute without spoiling anything he hasn t yet he s just focusing on fortifying the Red Rocket and finding mini nukes but I am eager to see who he ultimately winds up siding with I got my dad into playing Fallout 4,266,1054,1319

Fallout,Exploring the ruins of Boston most of our Sole Survivors have stumbled across D B Technical High School a raider encampment sprawling every habitable nook and cranny of the former Catholic Tech School As we can read from the terminal entries from across the wastes and particularly here the raiders of D B are headed by an insane man by the name of Bosco and right off the bat we notice some unique things Starting small let s look at his impact on the raiders around him For example should we kill Bosco before dealing with Saugus Iron Works Forged we note that the killing of Bosco is the only thing that makes Slag think Commonwealthers are competent This is coming from the leader of arguably one of the largest and most powerful raider bosses north of Pittsburg Not only that but we can find out that he has subjugated most of the Boston raiders into his gang with Back Street Apparel being the only independent hideout Continuing on noting Bosco s achievement we note that he has actual tactics on his side instead of throwing his men at the enemy like a hammer Taking a look into his terminal entries we discover that Bosco took out the Shamrock Taphouse gang by having a spy sneak into their ranks break the locks and then set loose Bosco s dogs Those that survived were offered a deal and they took it Now considering Shamrock Taphouse isn t empty when we find it we can infer the deal was assimilation To us living in the modern age this may seem basic and simple But these are revolutionary tactics in the age of raiders and slavers Not only does he use his resources effectively he knows when to shut up and stop his expansion We know this because he writes that he hasn t taken Libertalia yet because his men wouldn t know how to handle the terrain He knows his limits he conquers and makes deals to maximize his efficiency he uses tactics and diplomacy he s a genius compared to most of the other bosses We later learn that he was bitten by one of his dogs and is slowly going insane because of rabies He harshly punishes his own men and has even set up a throne with the heads of his foes by his side There is an obvious connection to Caesar He s a tactical genius for his era and yet is irrational and brutal And what do we get out of the great Bosco A repeating micro boss encounter where the whole gimmick is Haha funny bear head Bosco was a massively missed opportunity and I m ashamed of Bethesda for throwing him away Bosco A Missed Opportunity,461,2005,2465

Fallout,TL DR perks involved in Settlements and powere armor are unlocked and improved via gameplay not level ups Always was annoyed Settlement perks needed high charisma for a almost ecential feature and intellect really had no play resource management paving the way for more utility perks The new guns armor and crafting being used in 76 are good just tweak them a little and add more in the next fallout The way training would work is you get and improve it via training with a veteran powere armor user and using powere armor The lower its leve the more the ap cost for sprinting and vats is along with suffering a movement penalty high training move faster and unlock more modifications and better ap costs Improving powere armor training would also retroactively unlock additional perks that improve powere armor For powere armor weapons I saw the frank Horrigan miniature for wastland warfare had his knife and sword attacked to the armor So I wondered what if future games built on that The brotherhood designing weapons that exclusively work with power armor fits with how they d work It would require power armor training and they should hit like a truck Think a gatling lazor mounted to arms or shoulder mounted turrets The BOS enclave if their not dead and other factions have been using it for a while it stands they make improvements to its combat ability settlement are more self sufficient and the perks unlock via improving settlement not charisma I don t like its dependence on charisma store s and work benches unlock via having perks related to that store Ex level 1 gunsmith level 1 gun store and work bench Supply lines are unlocked inherently after geting 2 or more setliments And lastly settlers can build their own gear and arm themselves Just less micromanagement having to a settlement becuse settlers can plant a apple by their self is annoying Just let them generate resources for me in the background Thats pretty much it thoughts and criticism Some improvements Id like in the next fallout,348,1666,2013

Fallout,I know this dead horse has been kicked so much that it came back to life and got kicked to death again but where do you want the next Fallout game to take place in I ve a few ideas myself Chicago s one good place It was stated in New Vegas that there are Enclave outposts there and Fallout 3 and 4 mentioned a Brotherhood of Steel presence there as well It would be interesting to see another clash between the two factions New Orleans is an interesting place for a couple of reasons Seeing as the series has dabbled with the supernatural the all but blatant Lovecraft references in Fallout 3 New Vegas 4 and 76 as well as the cult in the Point Lookout DLC New Orleans with its long and storied history of the supernatural has all kinds of possibilities Also depending on how much water remains in the area the possibility of vehicle travel boats rafts and hoverboats specifically also exists Alaska the site of the last battle of the Great War before the bombs dropped Perhaps the descendants of the US and Chinese militaries as well as the ghoulified remnants of the original militaries are still fighting a war that has long since ended A good plot idea would be for the player to either win the war for one side or the other destroy both sides or find a way to forge a lasting peace between the two factions Depending on what the weather s like it would also be a good chance to expand on the survival system that Bethesda s been dabbling with the last few games New York Assuming the city hasn t been reduced to a Glowing Sea it would be an interesting change of pace going through tight alleyways flooded subways and across the rickety ruins of skyscrapers as opposed to the more wide open areas that the last few games have had Where do you want the next Fallout game to take place in,337,1455,1791

Fallout,Why Bethesda I ve played every elder scrolls game including Arena And every Fallout game including the Interplay ones I m sure this topic has been beat to death but I just want some other opinions After Fallout 4 is anyone excited for 5 They completely ditched good quest design for the building system I m sure New Vegas is everyone s go to however even fallout 3 had some great quests I just felt fallout 4 was a first person shooter with too many raiders to kill not enough settlements with interesting npcs or quests If I m wrong maybe I ll play it again But I had to slug through it and I downloaded 40 plus mods Did I miss anything or is that just how this game plays I m sure this is old I just now played 4 How do you all feel about Fallout 4 first playthrough here,153,621,773

Fallout,Maybe I m in a bad mood because im in the hospital and my hands hurt from swelling but I really wanted to clear something up about the vanilla assault rifle in fallout 4 All it takes is one look at the art book and game files to understand why it looks the way it does The assault rifle was literally the first weapon designed for fallout 4 and It was intentionally designed to be an oversized machine gun the reason it takes so many design elements from real life lmgs and hmgs is because it was originally supposed to be a pmg high hybrid it was designed to be a large weapon to look good when held by large power armor hands Dont get me wrong I hate the design too but I hate it in the context of its current role as an assault rifle If it went down the path of say fnv s lmg and was balanced to be a rare and powerful machine gun maybe even chambered in 308 then I would actually like the design a lot As for the game files comment in the game files all of the assault rifle meshes and textures sit inside a folder literally called MachineGun where as there is an assault rifle folder that contain an unused cut chinese assault rifle When looked at from the perspective of its original design intention then its bot actually that bad imo sure it looks weird with the barrel jacket but it looks weird in a kind makes sense ish way Ive always wanted to make a mod that rebalances it into a rare powerful 308 machine gun that falls under the heavy weapon perks Its a shame the Chinese assault rifle was cut and the what was supposed to be the machine gun was awkwardly repurposed into a role it wasn t visually designed to go in I dunno to me understanding the context makes the whole thing a bit more palatable and maybe I just don t want to default to dae bethesda bad because ugly gun Can we please stop misunderstanding the Fallout 4 assault rifle,359,1494,1852

Fallout,Marked for Spoilers because it kinda is marked for NSFW for a specific reason I think the only real redeeming quality about Pickman is that the people he s killing are raiders but he seems like he s probably one of the only Fallout 4 characters to genuinely be bat shit insane Plus here s the NSFW part has anyone else noticed how erotic he is The way he gives you a pet name and talks in a seductive tone leaving you a calling card in his safe with a heart drawn probably in the blood of Slab who you just killed I feel like that s a really cool little detail about him clearly being a full blown psychopath like a manipulation tactic to get what he wants I only did The pickman quest like one time when the game first came out but I recently redid it and I seriously did not remember this fact Overall 10 10 character probably one of the most unique characters in Fallout 4 and if you haven t explored the Pickman Gallery for some reason yet or haven t done it in a while I d really recommend going through it It s super short but Pickman is definitely an interesting character to meet Pickman sure does exist,216,896,1111

Fallout,It is likely that one day unless fallout dies because of bethesda s incompetence that the east and the west will meet It is likely since typically good guys win that the ncr will be at that meeting But who will be there from the east However in that same sense What will the ncr be by then and what is still now Personally I love the world that bethesda has made on the east coast The american retro future look of fallout 3 and fallout 4 pervades the map in such an interesting way that I can t help but love exploring their landscape The dense regions of destroyed cities prevails a since of great discovery hidden deep below Which is exactly what I think the whole east coast is It is a side of the country that is a beast of its own right trying to burst out of its cage The Commonwealth Capital Wasteland The Pitt Whatever West Virginia is going to nearly 200 hundred years later Whatever other big faction that may appear There is a country ready to be born Here s my pitch The East Coast establishes itself as the next america With inventory of the legitimate documentation and legacy of the first president the sole survivor This new america represents a return to the real america of old A dial back from the horrendous beast it had become by 2077 The context Following the events of a peaceful minuteman ending Conflicts whatever they may be in the form of war with the pitt west virginia rogue mid western bos faction the long shot legion or maybe a waaagh horde of supermutants with deathclaw mounts arrises and requires that the three wary factions have to fight together in order to prevail Uniting through the sole survivors acquired charisma as the general of the MM and civilizing the whole northern half of the commonwealth Through a series of trials falls and rebounds in diplomatic trust Along with compromise being the cornerstone of diplomacy A real sense of camaraderie blooms into a united forces The reason America 2 0 or maybe 5 being possible is the sole survivor s hinted disillusion with pre war america With his relative experience with pre war america and plot points hinted from the intro scene He could have a since of retro patriotism Which would have been grown by the grandfather he mentioned Couple that with his archetyple general role on cusp of a new country He ll likely be the one to lead the EBOS and RR into a new rule amp x200B Why this division of the country between west and east matters While the ncr does represent america with it s democratic ideals and values It is still a far cry from true american ideals and established governing strucutre From my understanding the ncr government and constitution also lacks all the pre existing conditions for a true american philosophy While in the east there seems to be a big plot device that american themes still prevail All the documentation The old world government structures The militia There is also the fact that America from before it became a united commonwealth was a constitutional republic While the ncr is a federal unicameral parliamentary republic based on the principle of representative democracy The differences wouldn t end there The NCR would have more emphasis rapidly expanding imperial esk traits While the east would have more emphasis on industrial expansion and technological innovation due to all the exiting factories still seemingly operable and the EBOS s technical and manufacturing guidance amp x200B When they meet in the middle There will be significant differences in ideology and values between the nations That there would likely be war I m honestly not certain how the two would have progressed by that point The kind of development that would be required for the east here would likely take a century Beforehand they would be significantly weaker than the entire brunt might of the ncr However there is still the huge of middle america and the legion forces that should still exist albiet divided like old rome that should act as a solid buffer keeping ncr somewhat contained on the western side At least for a good while for which the east could have finally gotten on its two legs amp x200B Who would win Idk The ncr is big and there is no telling what new branches or what kind of military arms it develops by then For the east there is going to be a lot of things to consider and a likely hood for solid variability in capabilities It ll likely have a developed cia of some sort due to the early espionage practices that were exposed to it thanks to the RR There is the army that would likely have a solid growth from the MM There would also be the space marines who could project a solid offense anywhere at short notice due to the EBOS s established advanced fighting doctrine with combined arms and integration of technology with power armored infantry rifleman amp x200B Thank you for reading I had to get this off my chest I ve been having a huge fantasized rewrite fanfic of fallout 4 in my head for several years now After realizing the significance in differences between ncr and america and the possibility of new america I just needed to put this small part of it out there FanFic Idea

Fallout,So as we all know Honest Hearts is the second dlc for Fallout New Vegas and in my opinion the most disappointing one I remember when I first played Dead Money and how amazed I was by the aesthetics it was still new vegas but it had a very distinct feel to it You could tell Obsidian put a lot of effort into designing the world characters creatures armor and weapons So when I started Honest Hearts I had a lot of expectations When I met the Happy Trails caravan and heard the stories of Zion and it s tribals I was really hyped the caravan members themselves were cool characters too We arrived at Zion the scenery was breath taking Jed and the caravan guards were such interesting characters I was ready for an indians vs cowboys type scenerio Then all my caravan buddies died I was suprised but intrigued maybe this was going to be a tribal vs tribal primal warfare kind of deal Then they started shooting with automatic rifles First of all let s talk about the Tribals They look amazing their aesthetics and the details went into making each tribe look distinct are simply a work of art But they wield submachine guns powerfists shishkebabs and other technological weapons as such I am aware of the lore reasons behind the existence of those weapons but that lore was introduced in Honest Hearts at the first place so fair game Just imagine how cool it would look if the tribals were carrying only the primal weapons like spears tomahawks or war clubs it would create a contrast between the more civilised Vegas and Zion And I would have really preferred had they introduced bow and arrows instead of just another submachine gun On the other hand Joshua bringing 45 s to Dead Horses to give them an edge against the White Legs is a good idea as Joshua is a new Canaanite and 45 pistols were invented by a mormon But when I see tribals running at me with automatic rifles and shishkebabs it feels like a lost opportunity They don t feel uncivilised as we were lead to believe They just don t give off that primal vibe tribals of Arroyo gave in Fallout 2 And this makes it hard to distinguish the tribals from fiends or other raiders Second let s talk about Zion itself Where are the animals Where are the deers the owls the amphibians the condors A mutated bird of prey or a radstag would fit perfectly in Zion but they choose to put the same creatures as in mojave Why is the water so clear How are fish in it and not in anywhere else And this is my biggest problem Why are they calling the bears Yao Guai The barely English speaking Sorrows know Chinese or something The mutated bears are called Yao Guais because the Chinese people at the internment camps called them as such So did the Sorrows a closed community that never left zion had contacted one of those internment camps and learned what the mutated black bears which aren t even native to Zion are called I think the voice acting is terrible and is the worst of Obsidian I like Joshua and Daniel their philosophy is interesting and so alien to the wasteland I like the story of White Legs invading Zion to appeal to Caesar I like the story of the Survivalist And this is why the dlc as a whole is disappointing With some changes it could have been perfect but Obsidian chose not to make these changes thus making Honest Hearts underwhelming My problems with Honest Hearts long,617,2725,3341

Fallout,this is NOt a rant about the backstory of characters and shit Hey it s me again The complainer Companions We love most of them and they bring company to your game The other games did a great job at companions a good backstory to them and made them like able The main thing is they made them good at combat and action In general Then came fallout four The companions are even more fleshed out in this game with their own likes and dislikes Bethesda did a amazing job at making companions likable but failed and making them good at actually being companions One problem I noticed is how most of them come with shit guns like db shotguns and 10mm pistols Sure some come with decent weapons like Paladin dance and his laser rifle but most come with bad ones Another problem is that they have really really bad aim They can t hit their shots unless the enemy is right up The only one who can actually hit stuff is deacon and old long fellow but that s only 2 out of the many companions Due the this they eat through the ammo that you give them for the the guns you gave because their weapons suck My last problem is a obvious one they are buggy It s fallout 4 of course they are buggy But companions really struggle to do basic things like orders or fighting Again some of these problems don t affect some companions but most do But at the end of the day we got dog meat so like that s a win My problem with companions fallout 4 s companions,279,1158,1436
Fallout,So I m somewhat young sitting at 21 and I got into fallout when I was 9 with fallout 3 since then I ve purchased all the fallout games but could never get into 1 and 2 because I ve never been a fan of top down isometric turn based games but I m a huuuge fan of lore in games and immersing myself in the world and I feel like I m missing out on sooo much stuff especially in new Vegas I had no idea until I started browsing this sub a few weeks ago that new Vegas had such strong connections with the first few games if anyone could recommend somewhere I could either read or listen to watch an in depth explanation of the lore Or a good play through that doesn t miss much Fallout 1 amp 2 lore,144,550,693

Fallout,Let me start off by saying I love fallouts quests I think they are a enjoyable branch off from the main quest My problem is how they just don t feel natural Let s say I get a quest and it just auto points me to a random location to either find something or someone I wish they felt more natural like ask around for the location or investigate someone s room A good example of this is the Chinese stealth suit creation club You would have no idea that that is where the suit is the game just shows you there It would be cool if the quest starts out like grab a drink from the diamond city bar or you find a random raider with a note to the location of the armor While yes some quests are like this most aren t I feel like if the quests introductions were more natural and not just go here they would be much better My problem with fallout quests,170,675,844

Fallout,If they ever make another Fallout game I d like to see them explore communism in one of the factions And I mean like actual communism the economic and social philosophy of communism not the goofy one dimensional caricature found in all the in game propaganda Something a bit more nuanced and rounded than simply slapping a red star on a hat and calling everyone comrade Fallout has explored many other types of government and philosophies anarchy democracy autocracy plutocracy imperialism totalitarianism etc but communism just seems to vaguely exist as the boogieman of a bygone era something that all the crazy robots shake their metal fists at going grr filthy commies grr and that s it Honestly I think it would be interesting to see how a communist rule would fare in post apocalyptic America They could explore its strengths and weaknesses maybe make parallels to real life communist countries and pit it against different factions with radically different beliefs Players could learn more about communism and even discuss and debate over its merits and flaws the same way that we still debate over the various factions in New Vegas I mean I honestly don t know much about Communism and from what I ve seen a lot of Americans know even less about it beyond that it s bad in a non specific manner What do you all think I d like to see a communist faction in Fallout,241,1131,1371

Fallout,I ve played New Vegas a lot and every time I beat the game and watch the ending slides Veronica is stuck with an ending that kind of depresses me From the moment you meet her it s clear she s at war with herself on how she feels about the Brotherhood and she s genuinely worried about their future She thinks that they are on a doomed course and in my opinion she s right You go through her quest and you watch her fight to change the direction the Brotherhood is going in members of the Brotherhood show open hostility towards her and depending on how things go they try to kill her and she eventually realizes that they won t truly change no matter what she does And no matter how you finish the game her ending is always with her living with people who don t like or trust her or just flat out being totally alone It makes me feel sad because every other companion in New Vegas has at least one ending where things look like they are going to turn out okay for them It kind of sucks to be Veronica Santangelo Spoilers,200,821,1020

Fallout,If the next Fallout game happens to be set in Texas here is an appropriate quest I think Imagine that you re trekking down some overgrown country road The highways can be dangerous especially the further you are from civilization You re passing by an old driveway the stone mailbox still stands when you see a man running down the driveway to you He s armed but not holding his rifle as he approaches you This guy doesn t seem to be a survivalist so he s probably okay He s traveling to Houston a k a Space City from Lafayette He explains that in Louisiana the only significant animal threat that he faced were the mutated alligators and his double barreled elephant gun was perfect for snuffing them out Now though in East Texas there are more wildlife threats and they can move faster and they can move in groups He wants to know if he can trade for an automatic rifle He s temporarily squatting in the house at the end of the driveway and he s worried for the safety of his kids If you downplay his fears he indignantly retorts How am I going to kill the 30 to 50 feral hogs when they run into the yard while my kids are playing If you trade him an automatic rifle he will not part with Perfection his elephant gun and some ammunition he ll say Thanks and you ll find him and his kids in Houston later If you don t trade him an automatic rifle and also don t tell him that the Ghoul technicians down at the Bay City nuclear power plant are looking for a full time hunter to kill the mutated alligators that keep nesting in the cooling reservoir then if you ever return to the house then you will find him and his children have been trampled to death If you don t trade him an automatic rifle but volunteer to kill the nearest threatening sounder of feral hogs he ll thank you and seek refuge in the house to wait as you slaughter them If you tell him about the hunter job then you ll find him in Bay City a week later If you kill him and don t kill the feral hogs then the kids will run into the woods and never be seen again However coincidentally the survivalists in the area will demonstrate greater skill at booby traps and sniping unless you have already killed the survivalists If you kill him after killing the feral hogs then his kids will go catatonic and remain the house After you leave the area a new traveling family will adopt them Then the next time that you go to Houston you will discover that you have permanent damage to your reputation If you want to be an asshole then you can track down the family and show off Perfection to the orphans The step dad will then crowdsource retaliation that will unexpectedly stalk and harass you around Houston for the rest of the game However if you return Perfection and apologize to the orphans then your reputation will improve with time and the vengeful stepfather won t try to have you harmed I don t have a name for the quest though Anyway yeah what kind of quest would you like to play Sometimes I daydream quests for my Fallout sequel anyone else do the same,576,2449,3024

Fallout,Worst to best Fallout BoS Doesn t need a reason as to why the story sucks Fallout Tactics Not very story heavy it s a gameplay focused game Fallout 76 The story doesn t make much sense 500 people were supposed to be in Vault 76 but only a limited amount of people are on a server at once This means the world is both underpopulated according to written lore and overpopulated The story is also a big big trail of notes left by people more interesting than you or your situation Fallout 3 Unpopular opinion but I think Fallout 3 takes the story elements from Fallout 1 and 2 but completely misunderstands why those stories are so good The ending sucks and it sucks worse when it was retconned by Broken Steel Youre rarely the main character Fallout 4 This one deserves more credit because Bethesda at least came up with the villian on their own That being said the Institute s motivation is non existent and the player character no longer has a unique personality Father is your son twist makes this game feel like a disney story Fallout 2 A near perfect narrative continuation of the first game the plot points and universe elements are advanced in a realistic and understandable way for the most part The villians are a bit too mustache twirling but they have an understandable motivation and Frank Horrigan to make up for it New Vegas Again a near perfect narrative continuation of the game that came before in the timeline It copies Fallout 3 s chasing a guy across the wasteland however it feels a lot more natural and it only takes up the first act It is also completely skippable Fallout 1 A game with a 10 10 story Master is a sympathetic villian giving him the balancd of being both unforgivingly evil and correct from a certain point of view This one relied on no iconography and does the retrofuturism thing really really well Tell me if you disagreed I love to argue Ranking the Fallout games purely on story,350,1570,1919

Fallout,TL DR I believe New Vegas destroys Fallout s ideas by taking them to their natural conclusion and subsequently ruins the possibility for a game that has a story that keeps the themes and ideas of Fallout mainly War never changes and its counter But can we change Please let me know your ideas for where the next game should explore thematically and it there is anywhere left to go amp x200B I think that Fallout 5 has run out of places to go The Fallout series generally revolves around the idea of history repeating itself through the idea of war War never changes The way we fight may change but it will always be caused by the same human evils Greed wrath etc Primarily greed as the Fallout 1 intro focuses on that idea a lot by pointing to the Roman empire and how greed is the same thing that drove humanity to destroy the world The way we fight evolved to the point that it was able to destroy us This idea ripples through the series as you explore the fallout of it and get to see the ways it still manifests itself and attempt answer the questions it present and serve to boost the idea of human division and greed War never changes In the first game you are also met with this idea s counter War may never change but can we The Master tries to change humanity in order to stop war in quite a literal way by evolving us into Supermutants that have no barriers of identity and in turn by doing this starts a hypocritical genocide History repeats itself Fallout 2 attempts to evolve beyond this idea and counters the counter The Master tried to fix humanities issues but ending up perpetuating them Now we can see a more direct parallel of the pre war world The NCR directly parallels the USA Fallout 2 takes place decades after the first instalment and demonstrates what the Master tried to stop The Enclave hate the rest of humanity as they are different than them The NCR have many issues of their own History is repeating itself yet also changing The wasteland changes There are fewer areas in Fallout 2 that are destroyed by the wasteland humanity has almost revived itself At the end of the game you can stop the Enclave and the NCR continues to grow will the NCR learn from history In New Vegas the idea of the wasteland changing are literally demonstrated The world s design is now 3d and the map is open world Civilization has repaired itself to the degree that things are reasonably close a more direct parallel for the real world The NCR meets the Legion and Mr House more literal representations of the ideas presented in Fallout 1 amp 2 These factions personify their political ideologies and allow these ideologies to quite literally battle Fallout 1 amp 2 s ideas crash together We can try to change war but often end up repeating it We must learn from history But when we don t change war the same problems arise How do we learn from history What is the right decision Can humanity finally change How do we change What is the right answer I feel that this takes the thematic ideas of the series and the wasteland genre to their conclusion Humanity is destroyed can it rise up again As it does through instalments the wasteland slowly becomes less wasteland y until in New Vegas you have literal cities Ideas of war and the management of them grow until they are almost unanswerable New Vegas is the best game in the series because of how it uses Fallout s ideas but at the same time it destroys them Am I missing something What should Fallout 5 be thematically Where should Fallout 5 go thematically,648,2874,3521

Fallout,The title is intentionally vague and open im stuck in the hospital for awhile now not covid and i want to just talk about some fallout 4 stuff like builds and stuff I recently broke the modders curse and actually had a substantial minuteman playthrough going before I had to run off to the ER and I ve been itching to back and play so in the meantime I want to occupy my thoughts with something other then pain with what my next playthrough will be I did somthing I thought was a bit interesting with my most recent playthrough i intentionally did not take any crafting perks and forced myself to rely on trading and looting to get the mods I wanted Im mostly interested in loud guns I use both single shot laser rifle combat shotgun lever action and hunting rifle and automatic combat rifle assault rifle handmade rifle and deadpool2099 s service rifle though stick primarily to automatics I try to use vats but I simply don t rely in it feels to finicky with the mouse I am interested in any opinions in that slow time mod vafs I think its called Really this a pretty loose discussions talk about playstyles must have perks especially perks obtained as rewards from quest weapons fixed legendarys particularly fixed legendary armor even gameplay balance mods though I try to stick a vanilla mindset with mods anything really the more written the better I would say the only thing i m not super keen on is melee I know its good but it just doesn t feel right to me Thank you Talk to me about builds in Fallout 4,280,1233,1512
Fallout,I feel like it makes sense It seems that the whole ideology of the Bos changed with Elder Maxon at least in the east coast I imagine that under the command of elder maxson they would expand and in some respects become the enclave 2 more enclave And in time they would be able to take over large areas and democartically ask locals for supplies I think the BoS could be the next villanous faction of the next game,79,334,412
Fallout,First off I understand this was mainly done for gameplay reasons but I just want to know if there s a reason in the lore for this What I mean more specifically is why did Vault 13 15 18 etc get equipped with Pip Boy 2000s while 11 21 34 101 87 etc get equipped with Pip Boy 3000s and Vault 81 111 88 95 etc get equipped with Pip Boy 3000 MK IVs I get that Vault Tec didn t exactly have the time to create one unified Pip Boy design but if they made the Pip Boy 3000 and had enough time to make at least 3 other versions then why did they give so many Vaults the objectively less useful Pip Boy 2000 missing Geiger counter no arm strap etc Also the Vault Suits are given different designs in the different games Though to be fair this may be more of an artstyle perspective difference that makes them look different The only thing I 100 understand is the difference between 10mm pistols I ve always thought the idea was that Vault Tec just bought whatever 10mm was most common in the region The Colt 6520 was popular in California so they bought them for their Vaults the N99 was popular in Virginia so they bought them for those Vaults etc I d love to hear the lore explanation for this if there is one Anyhow thanks for reading this far Is there a reason lore wise that Vault equipment differs from Vault to Vault,257,1058,1314
Fallout,We ve covered a pretty decent selection of time periods with all of the Fallout games so for the next one when would you like the game to be set Would you like it to be in the 2280s again The 2300s The mid to late 2100s again Personally I would LOVE to see a Fallout game set well during the fallout Some time around 2080 I really don t count FO76 in there the world just doesn t match up to how destroyed it should be at this point in time would be my ideal point while most of the Fallout games have focused on rebuilding civilisation or embracing the factions that have emerged from the ashes of the war I think a Fallout game set in the absolute turmoil of the early post war years would be awesome What about you guys What year do you want the next Fallout to be set in,156,619,774

Fallout,TL DR Could Fallout handle death in a better way than just loading a save Maybe the narrative could shift maybe you are given special perks or flaws to reflect that Or could the way saving is handled in Fallout be changed Ex Player crafted checkpoints Please let me know what you think of my ideas big post Recently I ve seen the request for the nemesis system to be implemented in Fallout This is currently not possible as it is patented by WB Games but Microsoft has allegedly been looking into buying that studio Regardless of licensing I think it would be really interesting to see a system similar to this in Fallout If you don t know the nemesis system is a system found in the Shadow of Mordor series of games It is essentially a system that generates relationships between the player and enemies You might run away from battle and an enemy will remember that next time Or an enemy may kill you and move up the ranks of the orc military For a better explanation watch this video watch v Lm_AzK27mZY One of the things that makes this system work is the fact that the player s death causes a shift in the power structure of the enemies but also that the player s death is part of the story This got me thinking about how Fallout handles death In these games when you die you load a save and your death is not considered part of the story But I think it would be interesting if the player dying could change parts of the story Maybe it could shift the power structure of the factions in the game causing one to take over the territory of another Either way do you think Fallout could handle death in a more interesting way amp x200B Maybe something similar to The Outer World s flaws system something Fallout could realistically use With the flaws system if you die to an enemy too many times you are given the option to develop a fear of it which allows you to trade higher damage from that enemy for a perk Shadow of Mordor is a fantasy series which means your character doesn t die because they are stuck between life and death Fallout is more grounded in reality which means there needs to be a way to account for this Possibly something like Bioshock s via chambers Maybe you don t always die and companions can drag you to safety if you are downed Maybe the player character has some special mutation that causes them to not die when they are killed but to further mutate into a creature of the wasteland gifting you access to more perks and abilities I understand this must be hard to implement This would not only make death more interesting but also make the game more immersive amp x200B Or maybe Fallout s save system could just be changed Abusing quick saves is really easily and boring Maybe players could save at certain in game points but also use materials to create a save point This way you have an interesting dynamic of I could save here because there might be difficult things ahead or I could use these materials to make better gear This also gives the things you find in the game world more value as you have a new important thing to craft amp x200B Please let me know what you think of my ideas Redesigning Fallout s Death,589,2562,3150
Fallout,A lot of Fallout fans particularly old school Fallout fans share the sentiment that the last few years have been somewhat of a low point for the Fallout franchise There has been a lot of talk about how to revive this series Disillusioned by Bethesda one solution which fans repeatedly propose is to allow Obsidian to produce another Fallout game Many people are convinced that this is the golden ticket to rejuvenating the lost spirit of the original fallout games What this suggestion ignores is that most of the key writers and designers who worked on Fallout NV have moved on and they no longer work at Obsidian HOWEVER even if the original team were to reassemble and start work on a sequel to NV I still maintain that this game would probably end up being a disappointment The hype surrounding this game would be immense probably surpassing hype levels for FO4 It would invariably be bulldozed by the hype train We all know how easily a game can be choked by hype There are very very few games made in recent memory which have truly lived up to the hype surrounding them Whether a NV sequel would pull this off is dubious at best If there was a sequel to Fallout NV made by Obsidian in the future it would probably end up being a disappointment due to the immense hype surrounding it,234,1055,1288

Fallout,Dual Wielding I think it would be a pretty great feature that allows for interesting gameplay It would function similarly to the system in Skyrim Not all weapons could be dual wieldable like Missile Launchers or the Fat Man to prevent them from being overpowered But most weapons would be It s an interesting idea that I think could spice up combat and comes with a view trade offs For example if dual wielding guns you wouldn t be able to use iron sights For melee you wouldn t be able to block as they block button would become the attack button for the secondary weapon Shields I also think dual wielding would work well if the next game implemented shields for melee combat I find it strange that no one in the wasteland has thought to use something other than their weapon to block Shields would also add another item for you to acquire and customize they could also come in different varieties A poorly made raider shield an old police riot shield an experimental energy shield etc Throwing Items In the games you can already pick up objects that are lying around After playing Half Life 2 and Prey I would really like to be able to have an option to throw some of these items You would be able to move barrels in front of people to blow them up stack boxes to vault walls move boxes that are blocking doorways or just fling items at NPCs If an item is larger it could be heavier to pick up requiring higher strength similar to Prey s leverage system Sliding I d love you to be able to hold the crouch key to be able to slide around This could make combat more interesting and mobile Maybe your sliding abilities could depend on your agility Low agility results in sliding like in Far Cry 4 an animation you are stuck in but allows you to quickly move around But sliding with high agility could allow you to slide like in Titanfall 2 with full aiming abilities I understand that this is probably a lot of work to implement but it s something to think about Dashing If not sliding maybe dashing Preferably both This seems a bit easier to add to the game You double tap the jump button and your character jolts forwards in the direction your were moving This allows you to dodge bullets and can make melee a bit more fun It might also add to more fun wasteland traversal It could be tied to AP to prevent total abuse Please let me know what you think of these ideas Some ideas I had for Fallout 5,452,1949,2400

Fallout,In fallout new Vegas we got the whole story of vault 11 and we learn of the sole survivor of the vault except the sole survivor would be long dead in New Vegas Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 That s where Fallout 76 may have some importance of course the Mojave wasteland is a ways away from Appalachia but maybe the sole survivor of vault 11 traveled there after the events of vault 11 just trying to get away from all that happened It sounds far fetched but the timelines match up and Bethesda knows we want to find out what happened to him maybe the sole survivor of vault 11 is somewhere in the game Vault 11 survivor in Fallout 76,122,506,627

Fallout,The Wasteland civilisation have proven to be very technologically advanced lets take the Brotherhood of Steel for example they have repaired modified and built legions of Vertibird helicopters rebooted from near scratch and then modified at least thousands of Power Armour suits even have a massive fully functional aircraft as a home and rebuilt and powered up a two century old war robot Not to mention all the other things like making an energy and light source from scratch building a fully functional teleporter from scratch and building carefully engineered defense systems from scratch If the people of the Wasteland can do all of this then I don t think it s much of a stretch to say that they could easily rebuild and power up cars Is there an explanation as to why there are no cars or what Why are there no working cars in the Fallout games,150,702,851

Fallout,I know that Fallout 5 is far off probably a decade or so Still I ve been replaying Fallout 4 lately and I ve gotten more and more confident in Bethesda Like a lot of Fallout fans I quickly dismissed FO4 after the first playthrough due to the lack of narrative consequences a bad dialogue system a lackluster story trying to constantly take the cinematic approach and the majority of quests just boiling down to go to an area kill enemies pick up loot and return However after going for a survival run and being inspired by videos online and friends irl to try out various builds I finally began to fall in love with the game Don t get me wrong the flaws listed above are still valid in fact they re highlighted even more on subsequent playthroughs Still things I originally was hesitant to accept like the leveling up system settlement building and new VATS system have actually just suad me to love it The perks offer utility rather than just number increases It s so transparent that you can begin to plan ahead for what you want to pick up The previous systems lacked transparency and if you ve played New Vegas or FO3 with a mod that removes the level cap you ll quickly see that your character becomes a master at anything before hitting 40 or 50 While in FO4 I ve gone for a VATS build and at Level 75 I m extremely efficient and op in combat and stealth yet my charisma sucks ass I have little to no health so if I m not quick on the trigger I ll get shredded to pieces and I lack so much intelligence that I can t craft anything and have to rely on what I scavenge I have a specific build with strengths and weaknesses Speaking of VATS the revamp makes VATS a lot more interesting Finally the base stats have more of an effect on VATS Previously all you needed was Agility for action points and Luck for a better chance at critical hits Perception had no effect on VATS btw I feel like Luck is way more useful as you get to decide when to initiate Critical Hits while in my New Vegas VATS build I felt like the lack of control over critical hits made me focus on building around base damage but with perks like Critical Banker and Four Leaf Clover I feel like it s completely valid to build a character based around critical hits That VATS slows down enemies instead of outright pausing the game adds a sense of urgency that forces you to act quickly and strategically It prevents VATS from being a get out of jail free card Also that enemies have specific weaknesses on their body parts so that you don t automatically aim for the head on every enemy goes a long way Like Deathclaws Belly Radscorpion stinger ghoul legs Mr Handy thruster power armor fusion core etc I feel like Fallout 4 has nailed a lot of the mechanics that makes Fallout unique The whole Fallout 4 is a good game just not a good Fallout game can die in a hole for what I care Yes Fallout should have a bigger emphasis on choice and dialogue but to say that those 2 things are all that make up a Fallout game would be selling the game short So Fallout 5 and why I m confident The Far Harbor DLC for FO4 shows that Bethesda is capable of writing interesting quests with good dialogue as the main quest of Far Harbor is basically the main quest of FO4 only 10 times better Fallout 76 shows that they have learned from the negative feedback that they got regarding the dialogue system and actually get this added dialogue with skill checks more than just 4 options charisma isn t the only stat with checks and it s not percentage based Sound awfully a lot like New Vegas and you re right it s pretty much the same So that Bethesda is actually adopting more mechanics from New Vegas is a good sign of them taking the best from both worlds The reputation system while not as deep as New Vegas returns in 76 Again best from both worlds Lastly addition from New Vegas that Bethesda actually improved upon in my opinion are mutations You now get mutations with specific trade off perks like Increased critical damage and perception but 4 strength from radiation And with the radiation system from FO4 you re trading your max hp to get a mutation that can hopefully benefit your build With FO4 as a starting point taking the dialogue system from NV and 76 the reputation system from NV the mutations system from 76 and quest design from NV and Far Harbor I think this game having a chance of being one of the best of the franchise is a no brainer Also not saying it s likely what so ever since Microsoft owns both Bethesda and Obsidian we might get a chance to have both studios work on the same title Even though a lot of the people that worked on NV has left Obsidian I still think Bethesda s immaculate world building and great core mechanics is a good match with Obsidians philosophy on quest design and dialogue Anyways that s my semi essay on why Fallout 5 is a game I m already hyped for even though it s not even confirmed that it s being worked on What do you guys think Any mechanics that you feel would fit FO5 that I haven t mentioned yet For the first time in any franchise I feel a sequel is going to automatically be the best game in the franchise,973,4159,5131
Fallout,Hi all as I said in the title I want to enter this series because I hear great things from it but I cant decide between Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 4 From what the general public says New Vegas seems deeper and with a greater story than Fallout 4 but then I check Metacritic and the second one is a bit more highly valued by the critics For reference I dont really care about combat I just want to experience a good story so my instinct tells me to try New Vegas first but I figured you guys would know better Thanks in advance New to the series Need advice on what game to start playing,117,472,588
Fallout,jesus i am horrible at this game i can t exactly tell why i am but i am I can t say something like oh i m bad in shooting or oh i m bad at looting items i can t point a thing to tell you exactly why i am bad but i am You know that feeling when you are only 8 years old and you re playing minecraft survival and the only thing you can do is a dirt house without even a door and you know that you are objectively bad at this game and you feel completely lost in the enormous world and you feel like the game offers you so plenty things to do but because a lack of skill you can t take those things It is like there is a relationship of dominance between me and New Vegas but just like a CSGO pro player domains CSGO i feel the opposite with New Vegas i feel like the game domains me when i m playing it there is almost no moment where i feel like i m in control of anything And the funniest part is that i FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME the whole game seems to be so damn great to me i have played 25 hours of it and everything i hear about the game makes me want to play more and more but i can t i can t properly enjoy all the things the game has to offer me because i feel lost in that enormous world therefore i fucking suck at this game btw this is not a big deal it s just a silly thing that came up in my mind and i felt that it would be cool to share this with you guys I ll keep playing the game tho i fucking sucks playing new vegas,312,1121,1432

Fallout,The Brotherhood of Steel The Institute The Railroad All these factions with huge influence on world simply crumble to dust And if BoS can still be somehow restored from deficiencies and Railroad may still have agents in different places then Institute is completely destroyed and in most stupid way And Railroad should self destruct because there is no need for it anymore if there is no Institute amp x200B Interestingly the Minutes are almost always allies Is this not a hint that according to the canon only they will be responsible for the destruction of the threats of the Commonwealth Also last DLC bothers me Is this not a hint that plot end SS became raider and took over the Commonwealth It would be silly As an example dovahkiin in the Dawnguard trailer became a vampire But that doesn t matter because of the Dragonborn ending Whereas main plot of Fallout 4 can be a line that shows how unprepared for wasteland human lives only hope and after hope collapses remains only emptiness and madness Then becoming a violent raider is pretty logical Are you also worried that all major Fallout factions are being destroyed in F4,197,936,1132

Fallout,So good morning everyone before I ask you anything I m gon na tell you about a few things I ve bought Fallout 4 since day one and started playing in survival mode since in came out I have something like a 1000 hours or so in this game I ve run quite a lot of different builds Stealth Sniper Melee VATS Melee PA Charisma Int and personally the one I like the most the Heavy drug user with automatic weapons I mean past a certain a level in my experience you can either Blitz a Mirelurk Queen or you can spam her death high on jet while listening to classical radio Having a semi auto rifle seems awkward yes there is the Gauss Rifle but it is so slow and the ammo is heavy rare and epensive So here I am today started watching MATN YOLO playthrough which gave me a Fallout 4 urge I don t like his build so much as I don t enjoy crouching all the time I haven t played the game for a few years and I really want to finish the main quest line this time even if it s after hours of wandering I ve been tinkering a lot with my SPECIAL stats and my perks I m the kind of guy who loves min maxing and here is what I came with My new character is currently level 13 With Locksmith Demolition Expert Lone Wanderer Hacker and Sneak I didn t take Commando yet because at that level you don t get much good auto weapons and I don t plan on taking any crafting skills I ve been playing with them a lot and in the end I find them too good I like gimping myself I like the struggle in the beginning of the game I just run with Justice a 10mm autopistol and the Hunting rifle dropped by a gunner near Tenpine Bluffs My stats right now are S 4 5 with Special book and up to 6 with the bobblehead simply for Strong Back carry weight is a thing and having to run around every half hour to base just to put my junk in my settlement kinda bores me I might even go for the Hip fire perk at some point P 4 5 with bobblehead Demolition Expert there is no debate on this perk the only question is should I keep it a level 2 or try to get it up to 4 E 4 5 with bobblehead for Aquaboy fearing the smallest puddle is no fun Just wondering if I should go for Adamantium Skeleton because breaking a limb mid fight s cks And I need your opinion on Chem Resistant And I still haven t tried the Life Giver perk C 5 6 with bobblehead for Local Leader now in the past I ve been messing quite a bit with settlements but at some point these settlers piss me off and I don t like leveling so much while building only to venture outside to get my face ripped because I m undergeared I might get into it or not just having the choice without having to invest in this stat is enough for me plus I like speech checks I 6 7 with bobblehead for Chemist which is for me one of the best perk in the game Should I go up to 8 for Robotic Experts And should I take Medic What about Scrapper Is it useful in a wandering run A 4 5 with bobblehead for Action Boy maybe I should go for Ninja L 1 2 with bobblehead I don t like VATS I know it s powerful but it can get buggy and buggy things kill you in this game I feel like drugs helps a lot more in these oh sh t moments Might go up to 6 for Better Criticals for those asking I m not planning on taking Idiot Savant early because I really think leveling too fast can do you great harm So here are more questions Should I go for armorer or should I wait for when I meet the RailRoad Should I go for Lead Belly because in my experience Purified Water can become heavy and drug usage is water consumming I ve been thinking about a build where I could be thirsty all the time for the Int debuff which would help Idiot Savant to proc but I might keep that for later when leveling becomes quite long I m clearing Corvega right now with no weapon buff perks except Demo Expert it s been quite fun But I m starting to feel the ghouls beefier and Raider Scums and Psychos are starting to spawn so it might be time for me to get my hands on damage perks But now where can I find a decent auto weapon without going too much south I m not going to buy Spray n Pray right now it might be overkill I was thinking about something like an autoPipe smg with drum mags if there is a guaranteed spawn for that I m really not sure about where I should be heading next if some of you can give me some advices on that Thank you for reading hope I get some advices Need some advices on my survival playthrough Drugs are fun so are auto weapons,905,3515,4419

Fallout,Many people will praise New Vegas for having the Courier be non predetermined as if that s a bad thing and also as if that s true For starters the Courier is predetermined The opening states how they re a courier and works with the Mojave Express It s predetermined you get ambushed and shot in the head If one wants to get real nitpicky technical there are heaps of traits characteristics in the dialogue trees The Courier also is further predetermined in the DLC Lonesome Road Stating you walked to and fro countless times helped the NCR countless times as a freelance courier and helped build a settlement and accidentally set if off Again none of this is truly bad Predetermined traits characteristics are necessary especially for the plot What would New Vegas look like if you didn t get shot and just got told go find Benny Or what would Fallout 1 look like if you were just told go find the water chip and just weren t given the part of being from a Vault Predetermined characteristics characters aren t bad I don t get why many people act like it is and I certainly don t get why people act like the Courier isn t Now for explaining the why predetermined characters aren t bad why does the Vault Dweller care about the water chip and super mutant threat Why does the Chosen One seek out a G E C K Why does the Lone Wanderer help start Project Purity All these questions have an answer All these questions are a part of the plot Predetermined Vault Dweller cares to find a water chip because the Vault is their home The predetermined Chosen One seeks out a G E C K because their family is in trouble Predetermined Lone Wanderer starts Project Purity because their dad worked on it and further sacrificed himself for it But why does the Courier care about the Dam Mojave What ties them to it Some have said the platinum chip But only one guy needs it House Caesar wants it but he doesn t need it But none of these are reasons why the Courier cares about the Dam Mojave They don t live in the Mojave no faction benefits or opposes them on their search for Benny the war isn t going to affect them This is how the Courier being non predetermined hurts to narrative of Fallout New Vegas If you ask why you don t get an answer The Courier gets no real benefit for fighting at the Dam because it doesn t affect their well being or anything at all Heck it s predetermined that the Courier worked with the NCR in the past so why would they suddenly join the Legion or House The Courier is Predetermined and Why Predetermined Characters Aren t Bad,479,2067,2545

Fallout,Hi so this is a story for an ending in fallout 4 It is where you side with all factions It would never happen in the game because when you see the Ned of the writing you will understand I m gon na start Part 1 You have just seen father who has just passed away Now you are father to the institute Who knew that your son was going to be the leader of the institute Now you were general of the minutemen elder of the brotherhood director of the railroad and father to the institute You now had control of the commonwealth It is weird isn t it Power The feeling of every action being yours to do without consequence You knew what you had to do though Bring them together All of the factions You decide to bring them all together in Boston to completely meet each other You stood on top of a building while you watched them all gather together and talk to each other each faction giving each other dirty looks You decide to speak Hello I ve gathered you all here today to announce some news that might come as an unpleasant surprise to you but it is the only way to restore the commonwealth I m going to create a new faction A super faction capable of ruling the commonwealth To you amazement they all looked at each other and just said ok You needed a name A name for this new powerful army Maybe Jackabombs No cringe and sounds like a raider gang Parryflappers No what the hell BlueHeads I kind of like that Makes us sound powerful but not like a bunch of murderers Makes us sound like heroes Huh That s the end of part one Tell me if you want some more and if I should change that name although I kind of made it cringe for a reason Fallout 4 alternative ending Megalomaniac,326,1348,1673

Fallout,It s confirmed that he was considered for use as a companion character https www usgamer net articles the making of fallout new vegas how obsidians cult sequel became a beloved classic if the player saved him at one point his dialogue in the Tops Suite is fleshed out to a conspicuous degree that lines up with a lot of the other people you can work with almost making me think that it s recycled material from a cut full route and a lot of material tied to the game like All Roads the Playing Cards and the opening cutscene make a much bigger deal of him than he actually ends up being Also there s the cut Mister Goody two shoes encounter It s clear the guy s role got heavily altered and scaled back over the course of development but then again a lot of New Vegas is like that Was the player supposed to be able to legitimately work with Benny at some point,167,695,861

Fallout,The game goes out of its way to frame the Bitter Springs Massacre as a big tragedy and the Khans as victims of NCR incompetence and or maliciousness Characters seem to ignore that the Khans brought it on themselves by attacking the NCR as soon as they showed up And from what I gathered the NCR did attempt to make them stop before Bitter Springs but Papa Khan just blew it off and assumed the NCR wouldn t be able to stop them While I can agree that the innocents of the Khans didn t deserve it the game doesn t seem to acknowledge that the Khans did the same thing Papa Khan brags about how the NCR couldn t stop their raids which presumably included killing innocents as well But when the NCR does the same thing it s an unforgiveable crime and these hypocritical raiding pricks have the gall to whine if the NCR and Kings make peace by claiming that the NCR didn t extend them that same offer before Bitter Springs Not only that but when the Followers tried to help them they decided to spit in their face by becoming drug dealers and supplying the fiends in order to harass the NCR which leads to a lot of death and suffering to not just the NCR but also the residents of New Vegas Not to mention their deal with the Legion supposedly includes being given free raiding rights through all of western New Vegas shpwing that at their core they re still just a bunch of glorified bandits And yet despite all this the game tries to frame the Khan Empire ending as positive which is just off NOTHING they do indicates that these bastards would ever make good city builders and yet the ending where you give them books of the Mongols who were totally good examples to follow right somehow leads to a good ending I call bullshit I dunno maybe it s just me but it feels super weird that the game tries super hard to make you sympathize with the glorified raider drug dealers Or when Papa Khan brags about raiding NCR caravans and homes there s no dialogue option to say anything on it The game literally allows you to threaten Caesar while you re in the heart of his camp so calling the Khans on their hypocrisy at the cost of making them hostile should also be there right Am I the only one who really doesn t like the Great Khans and thinks their great empire ending is bs,431,1840,2270

Fallout,Hi I m wanting to write a D20 modern campaign set in the fallout universe but I m coming up short for an ending for NV that fits I was wanting to go for a treaty between House and the NCR but I can t seem to come up with anything that fits House s or the NCR s agenda since House doesn t want to be under the NCR Congress nor does the NCR want to have a technologically superior city state running around freely Also the campaign would be set 10 20 years after the events of NV so I m really just trying to get the lore set up before I do any real writing What s viable to be a canon ending for Nee Vegas,129,476,604
Fallout,So at this point of my save file I am bored as hell I sided mainly with the minute men and BoS and destroyed the institute with the minute men There is like no more quests coming in So is it worth playing this game again and going down a different route Is it worth replaying fallout 4,58,228,285

Fallout,Hi everyone I ve been playing a lot of Fallout 3 on Windows 10 lately It was running pretty smoothly besides the occasional crash Today I was going through Point Lookout and the game froze This has happened before and I didn t think anything of it After forcing the game to close with my Task Manager I tried to reopen my last save file but the game freezes on the loading screen every time I tried clicking continue Continue and loading a previous save but it keeps freezing I tried installing a mod from the Nexus updating my driver and restarting my computer but nothing works I haven t had this issue until now so I m really confused why I m getting it now Has anyone else experienced this issue If so what did you do to resolve it Fallout 3 Loading Crash,145,615,759

Fallout,Has there ever been discussion of remaking the fist 2 games in the first third person style of 3 NV or 4 I don t know if there was ever a fan made mod of some other game game or not I d love to play them I bought the first 2 but they are hard to play on a modern PC too small to see well IMO Remake of Fallout 1 or 2,74,243,316
Fallout,Less annoying bugs like getting stuck falling through floors or unable to finish quests But I don t mind if there re certain harmless exploits or glitches they kind of become a staple of the series and make the game more fun For example you can change the ammo of any weapon into mini nukes in New Vegas or get across the map border at certain points Even classic Fallout has a lot of interesting mechanics that can be seen as exploits such as using the withdraw of superstimpak to kill people These exploits won t influence your normal playthrough and require creative thinking to find and utilize them You can ignore them if you want to but they could keep things fresh and interesting One of the reasons I don t want to use the unofficial patches sometimes is that they remove certain exploits which are not necessarily bugs Do you have a similar feeling or want to share some of your fun experiences with exploits and glitches The next Fallout should be stable and polished but still has some fun exploits and glitches as long as they aren t game breaking,193,867,1059
Fallout,I have tried it once a while ago but decided to refund it because it would help me get Skyrim probably sounds stupid I have heard nothing but great stuff from friends talking about New Vegas and was wondering that even if I disliked 4 that I could enjoy NV I enjoyed the first few hours of 4 but lost interest during the Minutemen quest where you follow them to the one street Would there be any mods I need to get for PC Apparently I heard someone say that a mod was required so the game wouldnt crash Also are there any mods that improve animations graphics at all As someone who has never played a fallout game rather than a few hours of 4 should I get New Vegas,131,535,665

Fallout,I managed to pull it off during my first playthrough of the DLC Honestly one of my favorite DLCs of all time and I d say it s the dead money of fallout 3 in my opinion Both DLCs can set you up for the entire game if you play your cards right but you can t ever go back to the simulations If you re doing a new playthrough of the DLC definitely do the Gary method to get the weapons out of the simulation Who has managed to get all the simulation objects from Operation Anchorage in Fallout 3,101,391,491

Fallout,Played fallout 4 but didn t put as much time into it as FO3 or NV I heard 76 is decent now and it s free on game pass so why not Oh my god the atomic shop the micro transactions the always online the constant hunger and thirst I m level 17 and i still don t feel like I ve got a good grasp on the game Like you can sell your in game loot for caps That s awesome But I don t think I have the time to grind or caps to spend to do that Also my camp looks like dog shit and you have to find blueprints for everything which I have no clue where to start I don t really play this game with anyone so coop isn t in the picture which I assume helps you more I did do an event with a guy who dropped 200 shotgun rounds so shout out to that guy that was cool This is more of a rant than anything Even though 76 has changed for the better it still doesn t feel the same I m still going to grind through though If anyone is in the same boat as me DM me and we can both be confused and play I just started playing FO76 and I m so overwhelmed,227,802,1028

Fallout,I love FO4 as a game but there are just some or a lot of things about it that can be annoying What are some of the general and specific complaints you have about the main quest line including faction quests And what do you like about it In general I dislike that you can t sequence break the main quest like run straight to Virgil compounding the lack of choice in the early game and making it feel linear Specifically I hate how focused the Valentine Kellogg and Piper conversations are on Shaun or your dead spouse Though there is a lot I actually enjoy about how the factions are introduced and I generally enjoy the quests the first time I play through them What are your biggest gripes with Fallout 4 s main quest line,137,587,723

Fallout,I ve played fallout new Vegas for a long time and every time I thought where are the unnamed raiders because you got the fiends and the khan s and that s pretty much it you dont got so many raider wanders like in fallout 3 you found actually slavers raiders in large towns cannibals just roaming the street and in fallout new Vegas the khan s are basically just drug dealers you dont see great khans just going to paradise falls and the fiends are just normal raiders how fallout new vegas handles raiders,95,411,505

Fallout,Recently got a gaming PC but don t really use it for gaming so I ve been intrigued to check some games out on it Is there any benefit advantage to playing on PC that don t have to do with graphics Anything that could potentially make my next playthrough different and as enjoyable as the first My first playthrough of FO4 was on PS4 is there any reason to do my next playthrough on PC,76,309,384
Fallout,Mine is using the mines in Fallout 3 I don t know why but using mines in Fallout 3 feels just right More so than any other Fallout game Popping up a stealth boy then creating a minefield and finally making noise at the end of it to lure a group of idiot raiders charging at you Ahh it brings back memories Seeing that 17 exp gained after every explosion sound was an amazing feeling That game didn t have good companions didn t gave great gameplay or a story But boy these small yet delicate details just hooked you to it BTW my favourite FO is definitely New Vegas Don t let this post fool you A great RPG can not be done without great story and characters Be safe Whiskey What is your favourite thing to do in any Fallout game,143,586,728
Fallout,Given that Fallout is and has been a roleplaying game I always like to give my character some motivation some theme or something to justify their build or what I m planning to do with it It s just really exciting for me to plan my little stories and follow them as I play to justify this or that thing that my character does or wears Here s a really really rough idea for my new character centered around a rifle build in Fallout 76 JOHN RAMIREZ Quite the sharpshooter famous for his pinpoint accuracy and infamous around Vault 76 for his mild obsession with the wild west Future Owner of the Moonshine Tavern always ensuring free hotel rooms and friendly prices Always fit for combat with his trusty lever action in hand he s always rootin always tootin and by god he s always shootin Wrote it in five minutes but I kinda like how it goes If you have one I d love to hear it Posted originally on r fo76 but it fits here pretty well too Anyone else writing background for their characters,187,802,988

Fallout,Anyone else hope in future titles we can actually have a character backstory or have a choice of options that isnt being from a vault or having any ties to a vault or even not being given a jumpsuit like in NV I feel like the whole saviour from the vault character is getting a bit overdone at this point Whats everybodies thoughts No More Saviour From The Vault Characters,70,304,373
Fallout,As alike Gen 3 synths are to humans they are not the same when it comes to living They have fake blood fake skin emulate breathing don t have to eat or sleep or drink They are just robots with fake flesh and blood around them So if you were to send a rocket with a synth and don t give them a suit could they still function Could a synth survive in space,74,281,354
Fallout,In Fallout 4 the first half hour of gameplay is taken place is pre war Boston 2077 Personally I liked the type of retro futuristic vibe that fallout 4 had showed within the start of the game Although it had bothered me a bit that i was only able to see so little of the pre war world Since fallout 4 had been released in 2015 and the release of fallout 76 there has been no confirmation that another fallout will be developed and finished any time soon So what if there would be a small fallout themed city town for fallout fans From fallout new Vegas to recent fallout 76 Yes perhaps it would take a while and a lot of money would need to be invested I personally would think it would be great Especially for other fallout fans I would like to know about your opinions and if you would have any other ideas to add on too the theme of fallout Much appreciated Fallout themed town,170,710,879

Fallout,After wandering the wasteland with Dogmeat and Rex this is something I ve been thinking about Setting aside cyber dogs exactly how useful is a normal dog in a world filled with Super Mutants yao guai rad scorpians deathclaws Off of the top of my head I can see dogs being useful guards as their sense of smell can alert its owners of intruders Of course hunting as well mostly rad stags mole rats and rad roaches And companionship But other than those examples how else would a dog be useful I mean practically every human is packing some sort of firearm whether it be an assault rifle or a pipe pistol a unmutated dog isn t gon na shrug off a bullet Not to even mention all the other physically superior creatures of the wasteland I honestly just see standard dogs lagging behind only really serving small niches more useful for a farmer and maybe a raider but other than that I m not really sure what else How useful are dogs in the post nuclear wasteland,178,780,957

Fallout,I have been patiently waiting for this mod to be fixed since November of 2020 and I ve reached and or attempted to reach out to multiple people during that time including the mod author the person who ported the mod modders who may know the original mod author but to little to no luck The issue with the mod is the gloves helmet ski mask and goggles are missing vanilla BOS combat armor clips through outfit on certain NPC s outfit is super buggy example when soldier s are shot it does a weird buggy texture emitting from said Soldier You Fallout fans are such nice people and have done so many nice things for me but if you help fix this mod for me I d be so ecstatic and happy I honestly will resort to pay you for your efforts if you d be so kind to help a brother out Can someone out there help fix the BOS Shadow Company Milsim Replacer mod for Xbox one Fallout 4,172,699,870
Fallout,Now it s not perfect but it s a hell of a lot better than the FO3 NV AI where all AI just walks directly at you This is fine for super aggressive enemies like Deathclaws but it s weird that a mole rat just sees you and changes from like a hundred meters away But in FO4 many of the enemies don t beeline I especially like the Radscorpion and Ghoul behavior The scorpions burrow under you and then go right for your taint while the ghoul feel like pissed off drunks I think this is really fun because it s done much needed variety to enemy behavior In fact I think the only change I dislike is to the Deathclaws They see you and decide they need to do a whole song and dance where they roar and stretch then do a little evasive maneuvers and only then do they really charge Deathclaws should really just fuckin book it for you They re the boss enemy and they should behave like they did in NV An overlooked innovation from Fallout 4 is the enemy AI behavior,188,769,956

Fallout,New Unstoppables Gorgeous idea of a user with a nickname Dexchampion99 ments m175a1 fallout_urgently_needs_a_reasonably_evil_faction gqclp1g utm_source share amp utm_medium web2x amp context 3 amp x200B Quote We also need more minor factions as well Your Boomers Khans Powder Gangers etc I thought about this while playing Fallout 4 and doing the silver shroud quest wouldn t it be great to have a minor faction of comic book fans turned vigilantes You have the silver shroud you have the random encounter with a Manta Man vigilante there s a Grognak costume and weapon that could have easily been a part of a quest maybe a friendly super mutant who wants to be like Grognak Perhaps you could find the original actress for the Mistress of Mystery that s talked about in the Hubris Comics terminals as a ghoul Best part would be that since they re a minor faction they could probably work with the different main factions Perhaps they can be a special unit in the Minutemen or BoS Or a fantastic distraction for the Railroad to take advantage of Or maybe you could convince them to work for the institute in exchange for the cybernetics that Kellogg got making them real superheroes and bring comics back into print so that they can experience new adventures of their favorite heroes based on their own deeds A great idea for a new faction in Fallout 5,235,1117,1351
Fallout,I know I know the Institute has done a lot of evil things And in any other circumstances I would agree that the Institute needs to be destroyed However here you the SS are game changing factor If you side with the Institute and the Minutemen you become leader of both That s right the General of the Commonwealth Minutemen literally becomes the absolute ruler of the Institute That means that if your character is a morally good one then the Institute stops being an evil boogeyman and it gets transformed into the ultimate force of good for the people of the Commonwealth From then on you decide where the Institute s resources will go to you can free the synths distribute technology with all the citizens of the CW etc You become the Institute and can command it as you will The Institute is not evil in itself it is like a tool like a hammer whoever wields it can either use it to do evil kill people or to do good build stuff you get my point So as good as the Minutemen get they re objectively the good guys pure good they re not very capable of rebuilding humanity s future The Institute in good hands can be a force of pure good as well with the difference that they re capable of achieving technological wonders And you know they ll be up to doing good stuff because the General of the Minutemen you will be ruling over them From then on you can do only good using the Institute s resources Hell you could even federate and form a Commonwealth wide government and annex the Institute and make sure they ll stay loyal for generations to come by firing anyone not compliant and making laws ensuring that they ll work in the interest of the CW So am I wrong in thinking it is the best possible outcome Isn t the Institute Minutemen ending objectively the best ending that there is in the long run,339,1464,1802

Fallout,Citizens of the outer Vegas region with assistance from The Followers of the Apocalypse via Tom Anderson have managed to teach its residents agriculture and form a farmers Co Op with basic refrigeration that is now beginning to do more than just break even in its ventures and Westsiders have gone so far as to organize a militia and raise defensive walls to deter raids by the Fiends When the NCR took control of the waterworks and began to sell it at an expensive rate bringing the issue of reliable clean water to light Anderson rigged one of the automatic pumps to periodically divert water into the North Cistern to provide an answer for their independence Locals grow enough produce to feed themselves and export to other parties while North Vegas a smaller quadrant of the area survive on trade exchanging protection from fiends and critters in the sewers that would endanger merchants gamblers and NCR citizens though their community prides themselves on their nack for survival and views them as soft All together it seems that mankind finds a way with or without a centralized government Diverting the power from Helios One to Freemont Westside giving them electricity easing tension between the Kings and NCR as well as getting rid of those scumbags St James and Dermot only makes the future look even more promising Upon further observation I m very impressed with the communities both Westside and North Vegas have created without help from the NCR,248,1214,1461

Fallout,I ve seen a lot of speculation from both fans online and games journalists that Fallout 5 is probably a decade away The logic always felt sound Bethesda is making Starfield and then Elder Scrolls 6 and then maybe Fallout 5 The weird thing to me is that nobody has changed their tune since the Microsoft acquisition They definitely haven t been shy about leaning into Fallout in their marketing The very first image in the video they released about the acquisition plete zenimax bethesda deal If they re rebranding all of Zenimax to line it up with the Fallout franchise it feels like they see money there and why would they wait a decade to cash in on that They have more resources now to throw at it to make more content in the universe happen sooner Is there something I m missing To me it seems pretty clear that Microsoft will be leaning into Fallout more but I don t see anyone else bringing any of this up and everyone still seems pretty doom and gloom about new Fallout content Is there something I don t understand about the video game industry or is it pretty clear we re getting more Fallout sooner rather than later,208,919,1126

Fallout,I m not sure if this has been discussed before but the pipe reflex sight is genius Since most reflex red dot sights would have probably been destroyed by the nuclear explosion finding one would be rather difficult Making one would be quite difficult as well as you must understand how they work and have the specific parts So making an improvised optic would be a smart idea The design of the pipe reflex is very crude as it is a hollow metal tube with a screw through either sideu However by tightening one screw and backing ot the other you could effectively zero the scope to account for wind The scope could be zeored for left or right winds So this seemingly useless crude design is actually a very veratile stroke of genius The pipe reflex sight is genius,140,622,761

Fallout,It is my understanding that having finished NV and it s DLCs most not all of the world content is basically carryover from Fallout 3 like assets gameplay systems Obsidian of course tweaked some formula and added some new systems over it like proper factions and much more elaborate companion system However the bulk of the content of NV is transported over from 3 with a orange tint instead of green I know Bethesda was the support studio of the game as well How much of Fallout NV did Obsidian make in reality,93,418,510
Fallout,I understand the developers have to spell check everything and all but in a world 200 years after the atomic bombs dropped you would think alot of people would not know how to spell or read or even know proper grammer so why wouldn t they purposely spell alot of words wrong and give most the entrys bad grammer it would make the game feel more immersive And of course they wouldn t do this to terminals in vaults or pre war terminals Why is every post war terminal entry perfect grammer,92,396,487
Fallout,I know its an old game and I forgive if this may seem outdated but I decide to give New Vegas a chance and for the past few weeks I m already in love with the game But the only issue I have with the game is the unbearable darkness I get from entering vaults caves or any infrastructures really and its so difficult to navigate even with my Pip Boy light on Although at most times this doesn t really happen because there will be times that the game will brighten at a normal rate where you can actually see where you re going but then there would be times where It just gets insanely dark to the point where I can t even play properly especially entering buildings where its just a void of darkness wherever I go amp x200B I don t have any mods running since I don t even know how to add them and I tried scaling the brightness at maximum but nothing really changed how do you exactly fix this issue amp x200B You can look at here to see how freaking dark the game gets all of a sudden a CYxMRqD Fallout New Vegas lighting alternately gets normally lit and unbearably dark,210,863,1072

Fallout,Only sane faction in past is the Enclave They weren t just evil scum It was an organized government full of conspiracies secrets and a desire for influence submission and control Be part of the Enclave and subjugate wasteland would be interesting Destruction of the Enclave is a huge loss of a great faction in which truth is currently progress After all they kept a lot nation secrets And knowledge that America s technology was based on Zetans is now lost amp x200B What could be replacement for the Enclave It must be an organized government that keeps country secrets and technology and is also possibly part of a mystical cult that aims to gain control and power It would be incredibly interesting to get a certain faction of Old Lords like Illuminati who are embodiment of Old Gods and used America to enslave mortals mind And if you become part of this faction then you can see and hear things that are the true essence Like Wild Wasteland perk only aimed at lovecraftian horrors and associated with madness and conspiracies around world It would be very powerful and interesting Fallout urgently needs a reasonably evil faction which can join,200,951,1150

Fallout,I know it s only been 2 years since release and it s likely to keep going for years but whenever I play the game solo I always look to it as a considerably better fallout 4 in perma survival mode There s some wonderful stories ingame and the mechanics are quite neat so I d think it d be nice to see it get a single player release or something along the lines where you can play the game up to a power fantasy level soloing nuke silos going on one man armies against the scorch beast queen And the countless improvements made to the game what I wished vanilla fallout 4 was The game to me has a surrealist charm to how they took fallout 4 and made it waaay better The new weapons added feel like they where high quality mods with how sleek the profiles are yet it s a smooth integration The revamped vats system in live time is amazing the backpack system and camps are lovely portable bases if all of this was added to FO4 I d be even more in love with that game The map of appalachia is glorious and honestly it s funny how I m going to end up in college there soon Sorry my mind was wandering today and I kept thinking of how much fun I ve had in game with the first 150 hours the point where a game become something special to me but I feel sadness when I realized that the issues I have with the game is that it s made to be multiplayer online Fallout 76 and hopeful it s one day single player release,283,1124,1406

Fallout,So it s still the pandemic I got time and I m playing New Vegas again which I haven t played since high school years ago Since then I ve gotten an education in literature rhetoric and writing so what I knew back then is just not the same as it is today meaning New Vegas is different or at least is far more revealing As a sort of self indulgent writing exercise I ve decided to log my thoughts here to share with others as I play through the game just talkin bout what I think is a pretty good game May get a bit philosophical a little bit like Ulysses a little like Joshua absolutely NOT like Edward and maybe a little like Cass Anyway here I do go FNV is in an interesting and complex creative position when it comes to its franchise it follows the vision laid out by F1 and F2 that s inherently at odds with Bethesda s F3 and F4 vision Even metaphorically it differs the main metaphor being Old World Blues Bethesda s vision of the Blues is nostalgic wonder that you could die for while the Interplay Obsidian vision says that the reason you die for it is because it murders you Hbomberguy the thought criminal cleverly pointed out in a jokingly way the difference between F3 s Born to Die narrative metaphor and FNV s Died to Live narrative metaphor In F3 you die to literally purify the land in hopes of returning the world to its rightfully balanced place where it isn t irradiated I can t believe it s not a Christ allegory In FNV you get shot in the and buried in an unmarked grave for carrying an ancient artifact of the old world only to be selected by Fate Destiny Obsidian Josh Sawyer whatever you want to call it to rise from your grave and break the stalemate of the universe In a way the contradiction has been reversed F3 wants you to die for the greater life of the world and FNV is already on the phone with Charon about rescheduling your trip down the Styx If you ve read literary theory you may have come across Northrop Frye and his book The Anatomy of Criticism His mission in it is to establish a science for literary criticism that didn t really stick though a lot of its DNA can somewhat be found in today s conversations about Genre As it relates to FNV s opening I think Frye s archetypal modes of stories gives a pretty interesting view of its metaphors and how it constructs its meanings Without going too deep Frye says that every story can be categorized under 4 modes Comedy Romance Tragedy and Irony These 4 modes then are split into 6 phases each with each of them sharing half their phases with another For instance Romance and Tragedy both begin with a hero s mythic birth in FNV s case ironically rising from the grave If you ve read anything about the Hero s journey this may sound familiar Comedy and Irony in contrast both begin with an immersion into the story world in this instance being New Vegas the Mojave and all its players You can probably tell form FNV s opening that its balancing all 4 modes and that s appropriate Because FNV is a an RPG with cOnSeqUENTial storytelling it can mold itself under any of the phases of any of the modes gravitating towards certain modes depending on your chosen route Independence for instance is very comedic in nature if good karma because it begins by questioning the social world around Courier 6 and proceeds to obliterate it for the birth of a brave new world part 2 That brave new world analogy which is actually said by Julie Farkas in the game in Freeside is interesting with how it operates in Fallout Naturally all apocalypse media suggests a brave new world from The Postman to Mad Max Mad Max is particularly relevant for the quote in the second movie about Max living off of the corpse of the old world and The Postman is basically the goofy prototype for FNV the novel not the movie Fuck the movie Anyway the point here is that with F1 we see the birth of the brave new world and in F2 we see it grow up F3 repeats it again because it s busy referencing its predecessors and FNV evolves from its predecessors by saying that the brave new world is no longer brave nor new The NCR are repeating the same mistakes as the country its replicating and the Legion are cosplaying the Romans with a nod towards Mad Max Meanwhile a neoliberal billionaire has risen from the grave and plans to bring the old world back with him FNV s world is one that s trapped in a loop of itself a stuttering record player and Courier 6 has to decide if they like the blues or not Another element of Frye that begins developing from the opening that becomes more present as the game continues is his archetypical mythoi As per his premise of every story having moralizing politics in it Frye has it that every story presents 2 kind of 2 and a half metaphorical realms representing its morals beliefs preferences ideals etc Frye is kind of in love with The Divine Comedy so the structure is based on Dante s mythology At the tope is the upper realm the ideal place of good and orderly things while down below is the lower demonic realm of chaos and destruction and bad stuff according the author that is In between is the more complicated material realm things aren t so straight forward When you start the game you know Courier 6 is going to New Vegas It screams at you from the distance at night when looking from the Goodsprings cemetery New Vegas is that mythic upper realm marked by its alien old world lights It suggests that second brave new world ironically built on the old old world and its god father figure Mr House it surreptitiously calling out to you That seems counter to what the upper realm is sounds like and another point about the upper realm is that it is often hypocritical lying to you lying to itself Vegas s lights ain t nothing but flickering taillights meant to run you off the road House as Vegas s representative god king doesn t care about your humanity he cares about your knees which you are currently not on right now Courier 6 doesn t know that yet but they can begin to suspect if you can intuit the metaphors in front of you I m writing these from week to week probably on Fridays I don t really mid if no one reads these I more so just want to give form to my dumb abstract thoughts I m actually at Novac right now but my next entry is probably going to be on Goodsprings Primm and the Powder Gangers There are some neat things going there about pro social and anti social beliefs going on there that I don t see remarked on often Anyway has anyone else though this deeply about the game or am I a weird alien in the room Aside On my criticisms about F3 I actually have a soft spot for it because it was my first Fallout It was my favorite through middle school and I still think there s something to say about its exploration the way it s a gallery of historical ruination That story though is meaningless and I think that s why nowadays I can t find the heart to return to it and I ve tried Thinking about FNV A

Fallout,That fucking Runaway s Holotape still makes me shed a tear everytime I find it on every single playthrough Such a simple simple setup with only like 3 objects for the enviromental story For this poor young woman pregnant scared hiding from her own family in a cabin she spent her youth at with only a dress and a pack of gum and a sleeping bag one of the last things she ever says aloud is will things ever be normal again And two hundred years later you come upon her skeleton laying dormant in her secret hideaway It just strikes a chord with me for how simple and mundane her problem was how common it is in our real world and for that to just be extinguished in nuclear fire in an instant Idk man it gets to me Rip runaway girl 2000 hours in Fallout 4 and yet,150,614,763
Fallout,sorry for grammer So for context I actually like fallout 4 a good amount but in my opinion the story could have been better and I know how they should have cut out the minutemen The minutemen are just a better version of the railroad and in im guessing a good amount of people s opinion the brotherhood also though the minutemen were way lamer Think about it if you side with the railroad sure the synths are free but the wasteland is more chaotic and raiders could be more rampant if you side with the minutemen there are less raiders and the synths are free Anyways my point is I think if the minutemen were cut out the story would have been more nuanced I found a way to make fallout 4 s story better,136,568,703
Fallout,Obviously in game it s presented as pure evil In my opinion the Institute are a group of really good people under really bad leadership But if you were leader of the institute you could stop the Gen 3 synths even being made you could treat them as humans and only produce Gen 1s and 2s This would appease a lot of people You have access to technology better than pre war it s the only place in any fallout game that is arguably better than places pre war It has the cure to the FEV virus and could find many more cures It has synthetic life which could be added back to the commonwealth synthetic plants and grass and could re add greenery to the area It also has teleportation and so could make travel between places easily and safe and could make the transport of goods easy It would be such a waste to waste all of this technology and arguably the most technologically advanced faction in any fallout game Especially because you are general of the minutemen an alliance could exist and the sole survivor could turn the institute from an evil kidnapping shadow into the shining light of the commonwealth Under the right leadership surely the Institute would be the commonwealths best hope,217,974,1190

Fallout,Lots of people ask which one is best but I say the world building is too realistic for a simple answer Talk to lots of people and pick your favourite The main faction is the NCR and they want to be like America This is a problem because it is widely agreed that America was one of the big reasons that nuclear war began The opposing force to NCR is the legion The main problem with them is their brutality and regressive opinions on everything You have about two main alternatives and there are several littler details that affect the world I don t remember what House wants after getting everyone addicted to gambling I ve never tried going independent because that seems like a terrible idea I think all the groups in new vegas are shitty,137,604,740

Fallout,Does anyone else think Fallout 76 got a little too difficult after the level scaling update Not that I think the game is too hard but it used to be doing the daily abs weekly SCORE tasks you could at least have the option of doing easier tasks to complete them It used to be that even me only a decently geared player never had too much trouble with enemies and now if I don t have power armor on I have a lot of trouble with enemies almost every day I play especially if it s a Yao Guai or too many enemies at once I know I can be doing a better job with gear but does anyone else feel this way Been playing since day one but once the Wastelanders update came out I played the game for over 300 hours in 2020 and got from level 25 to 119 and now I don t feel motivated to go on nearly as much anymore Opinions about difficulty in 76,172,662,833

Fallout,Far Cry 5 is the same game in term of having many gun fights in wide open spaces In Fallout 4 the ballistics weapons are hitscan I think laser weapons as well Only plasma has bullet modeling Fallout is already a much more interactive game than Far Cry 5 but the lack of ballistics modeling is disappointing and takes the fun out of sniping and using rifles at range There are soo many moments of these at the gunners overpass for example thicket excavations In Far Cry 5 even with a p226 you can actually see your bullets curve and drop And the hit is not instant it s the same as at an actual outdoor range At 50 yards it takes several moments before the bullet actually impacts especially slow handgun rounds This makes gunfights much more exciting the scrambles for a hill or a bunker or beachhead they actually feel like war So after several hours of Far Cry 5 or New Dawn gunplay in Fallout falls far short in my opinion I hope they have real ballistics physics modeling in the next game Suggestion real time bullet modeling,191,839,1029

Fallout,Dwarfes wiki Dwarf are people with a genetic mutation because they had a short stature They were in Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 and it s very strange that they weren t in New Vegas It would be very interesting gameplay players would have to come up with ways to get something from high places From social point of view this would also be very useful because Fallout was first to introduce people with such a disease not as mythical creatures but as human And possibility to play such character would allow ordinary people to see life problems and features of people with dwarfism They will have problems with power armor It is unlikely that it will be possible to wear it Also they will not be able to get things from high places and player will have to deal with moving things in order to succeed It would be great if dwarfes were brought back to Fallout 5 and they were be playable,164,716,879

Fallout,This is 100 just a fun theory I came up with earlier today while commenting on a YouTube video I am not a loremaster I have not played through every single game I just saw a video about the Fallout world outside of the United States and had a neat idea so I m sharing it Already making an edit before I post this little theory ballooned into a larger theory that I kinda want to write more about now If you take the time to read the whole thing I think you ll be entertained To me one of the biggest questions of the series is why Vault Tec created the vaults to run social psychological and science related experiments on people for hundreds of years This becomes a bigger question when you realize that it d be pretty useless information if the entire world was destroyed Why would Vault Tec design all of these vaults and as the some lore suggests may have began the Great War if they would be destroyed in the process Now there s a plethora of answers to this and this is just my own theory just for fun but I think a common argument would be Well Vault Tec built vaults so they probably lived in the vaults too I like that idea a lot and when I was prompted by a YouTube video about the Fallout world outside of America I came up with this the Great War didn t affect the Old World Bear with me As per Ron Perlman s beautiful narration of Fallout 1 the pre War world was mostly composed of the territories taken over by the United States bickering nation states in Europe and the Soviets and Chinese Tensions were high everywhere and at a drop of a hat the world could end At least as far as we are told in the games While I will not contest Perlman s narration my theory is kinda built around the concept that tensions weren t as high between the Old World countries as they were between the Old World and the New World continents Obviously the European Union and the United Nations were disbanded and there were some tensions between Europe and the communists eastward but China and Russia were more focused on the Americas So in the decades leading up to the Great War a group of intellectuals entrepreneurs businessmen and scientists form a group bent on gathering information that will help humanity survive the inevitable destruction of the world They originally come up with the idea of the vault system and decide to begin the construction in the United States as it would have access to the materials required to build the vaults Along the way some bickering begins between the project managers as construction begins Obvious problems come up like how they are going to get the data from the vaults how they are going to get volunteers etc Then questionable ethics come up Some of the more morally righteous leaders of the organization criticize some of the puzzling experiment choices such as Vault 34 s violent nature The quarreling bleeds into all facets of the project More and more support is gained for the unethical vaults Soon members of the project begin to form bickering groups and all are forced to join sides in the debate Most of the supporters for the cruel experiments are financial backers and politicians At the tipping point of the debate one of the members of the board of the project announces that the financial backers are leaving the project and all of their property and assets will be reorganized into a corporation called Vault Tec The newly established Vault Tec would go on to serve for the benefit of humanity in the long run effectively turning the vault system into a widespread experiment spanning the entire United States from coast to coast As decades pass and the project nears completion the tensions between the U S and China escalate faster than Vault Tec anticipated and they realize that war is coming soon and the United States may be the first to fall As the day of war comes Vault Tec s aristocracy made from trustees backers politicians and scientists flee the nation to make a gamble They set up a base of operations in Europe and start to influence the politics of Europe Through the company not only is protection from nuclear winter promised but some of the riches of the United States resources are also brought to the continent The independent nation states governments begin to take bribes and offers of sustained protection They unofficially join the company hoping to outlast the common populace in the promised vaults Both the European nations and Vault Tec begin contacting China to sign a treaty between the continents Vault Tec plots that instead of China attacking the United States and getting destroyed entirely they move their operations out of China and into the near empty regions of the Middle East and Western Russia This mass evasion move coupled with Vault Tec s access to their experiments results and data would allow for the Old World to survive even if most of it is destroyed As long as the Chinese and European governments keep Vault Tec protected and safe they can survive the Great War So it ends that the agreements are made and China begins to move into western territory Before they can properly settle into Eastern Europe and the Middle East Vault Tec utilizes a missile silo they built into one of the northernmost vaults in the annexed territory of Canada to attack the U S This prematurely begins the Great War The U S and China both think it is the other superpower s doing and launches the cataclysmic attack The U S is destroyed China and Russia suffer massive blows destroying the majority of their populace As per the treaty the Chinese do not send warheads to the West Vaul Tec remains in the safety of the Europe free from destruction and with it s influence on every remaining government body Life continues in the Old World continents and eventually the Vault Tec experiments serve their purposes leading to safer facilities and self sufficient societies to take hold in Europe These would go on to expand into China and Russia utilizing the GECKs to terraform the landscape back to a habitable one Society continues in both the Old World and the New World in more ways than one TL DR Vault Tec begins as a good guy trying to find a way to survive a nuclear holocaust gets tripped up by the issues of capitalism and imperialism and eventually sets up a base in Europe Base in Europe leads to contacts to China and some big brain moves that lead to Vault Tec starting the Great War Over time Vault Tec utilizes the data they have gotten from the American vaults to resettle the Old World continents with sustainable society with fail safes against further nuclear holocausts My Great War Vault Tec Theory,1187,5423,6609

Fallout,So I recently finished Prey 2017 by Arkane Studios and I noticed that a lot of the things I liked about it were things I liked in Dead Money TLDR Dead Money is trying to be an immersive sim because it makes the player pay attention to the game world in order for them to succeed and understand the context of the story To make my Mildly Warm Take Late Realisation more thoroughly Success in both games requires paying close attention to the world and the way that things react in semi believable ways rather than relying completely on player skill stats Some examples from Dead Money would be making the connection that old fountains chips using the audio logs to swap between God Dog paying attention to the various trap locations Trip wires in doorways bear traps in the Cloud hologram speaker locations The one that I feel is unique to Dead Money is taking the gold bars which is managed completely by the player and how they get around Father Elijah and the Vault trap It s kind of why I wouldn t even concider the methods that let you steal all the gold bars an exploit as it s players using the way that Elijah reacts against him This is in opposition to for example the infinite gun glitch at Camp Guardian were you just bounce between 2 repeating dialogue options In regards to Prey specifically I think Dead Money shares some similar ideas Enemies that are best dealt with using unconventional methods crafting systems reliant on returning junk items to be broken down backstory told via note recordings and world details like corpse placement I m not saying all these ideas land perfectly I completely understand why Dead Money is so divisive but for me personally it was a moment of clarity I finally understood what made me love Dead Money s gameplay I ve realised Dead Money was an Immersive Sim after playing Prey,329,1499,1827

Fallout,Fallout is a world of retro futurism old style hypertrophy Plunge into this atmosphere and imagine who you would be in that world amp x200B If it s hard to imagine that imagine what your character would be based in F4 story As an example of my character His name Adrian Adrian Volkov Bored philistine a weasel with morbid curiosity In pre war life he was a nobody Or so it seemed But after bombs fell was a chance opened up that not everyone gets Adrian became a ghoul This opened up many opportunities for satisfying his irrepressible curiosity As he drifted around the world until got the Commonwealth Adrian became embroiled in intrigues wished he could stay away from Working with local resistance Adrian worked his way higher and higher toward mystery that surrounded the Commonwealth world and the Institute To a secret that would allow to get a nice prize and get rid of imposed obligations Along way Adrian met a lot different people pretended to be friends with them but did not let anyone get close to him He go a bodyguard a member of the Brotherhood of steel who has one big secret Brotherhood rejected him and Adrian took him in This gear is a loyal like dog that Adrian uses as a bodyguard and to warm his bed These are hard times and danger is getting closer But Adrian can handle it In any case running away is also an option Main thing is to have time to mix cards so that all pieces fall into a pile and destroy each other Ghoul life is too long and need to somehow entertain What kind of retro futuristic character would you be or yours main character,290,1281,1570

Fallout,Introduction I write this first because I have seen many topics on this subreddit about this issue and mostly partial answers or slightly incomplete tutorials which helped me lots in building this but I think there is the need of a full tutorial Second because I have no friends who play RL and I m a Switch player so I had noone to ask how it s done and I ve seen no complete tutorial of how to make it work There are multiple steps and there is no place where you can find the whole process but only pieces of it Third and final because there ve been events like RLCS and Goals for Change these days that have activated rewards and many people in the chat have doubts I hope this is helpful Procedure Steps 1 Connecting Nintendo account to Rocket League account in game 2 Connecting Nintendo account to Epic Games account 3 Connecting to Twitch and getting rewards 4 Redeeming drops 5 Troubleshooting amp x200B First step Connecting Nintendo account to Rocket League account in game This first step is the most overseen and causes trouble later It is pretty simple though just go to the Main Menu in the game and then go to Settings and then to the Extras tab You ll see an option that says Link to Nintendo Account as can be seen in the following image amp x200B Vincular Cuenta de Nintendo Link Nintendo account https preview redd it 5yhrptglraq61 jpg width 1280 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s a4140e3d8a522b878f75decbeeb51a71834fe7af Click it You can get either a success message or an Error message that says that your account was already linked In that case you shouldn t worry Second step Connecting Nintendo account to Epic Games account To do this you have to head to activate and log into your Epic Games account and Nintendo Switch account and any other you want to link The site will then ask you to choose a primary account Choose the Nintendo Switch one Unless it isn t your primary in which case you probably shouldn t need this guide lol Connect your Epic Account and your Nintendo Switch one Then choose the latter as the primary account https preview redd it armqykkfeaq61 jpg width 1346 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s

Processing img ij6hi7l7qaq61 Fourth step Redeeming drops When the bar reaches 100 you can click it and it ll take you to the inventory page Here you can redeem your drops The ones full coloured are

you can get 3 drops from each channel or set of channels and you have to watch 4 hours to get each drop These numbers can change Next time you play Rocket League you should see something like this amp

message in the third step that says that the accounts couldn t be connected That happens when you don t do the first step It happened to me and it happens to most people because it is a pretty weird step that noone mentions amp x200B gt I have more than one user in the same console and we even share the Nintendo eShop How do I link my second user and not the default one Each user is associated to a different e mail account To find out which e mail that is go to the top left corner and click your icon You ll see the e mail associated here You can identify the right e mail although it is

bar what s the issue It could be that the accounts are not connected as they should You can check that in the Connections section on Twitch s page or maybe you collected all the drops available per stream Make sure the stream is not paused or you won t get any progress amp x200B Final Words Hope it was not too long or too hard to understand This is the first tutorial I ever make for Reddit and I just wanted to help my fellow Switch players Best of lucks to all of you I ll be updating the guide if more questions appear Ultimate Guide to link Nintendo Switch account for Twitch Drops and how to

Fallout,Hello Since Epic acquired Rocket League when we launch the game there is a sequence where the player is forced to do a serie of 5 inputs in a scripted training game There is no option given to the player whatsoever to skip this introduction sequence nor is there an option to change your control settings This is a CRITICAL issue for quadraplegic players using or other similar controllers that require access to a setting menu before playing they need to have the option to adjust their settings before being forced into the game Right now the game doesn t provide this option for no reason other then to create immersion on game launch I am looking to get this issue resolved ASAP and have already sent an email to Tim CEO of Epic Games Developpers should strive to make gaming accessible to as many people as possible and this arbitrary limitation prevents any players that have special adapted controllers from even getting to the settings menu only to have a cool looking game start experience A very quick fix could be implemented in a few days of work at most of adding an option to skip this introduction sequence This would make your game available to people with accessibility needs again We need a fast response regarding this issue as it is blocking quadreplegic players from accessing your game and this is unacceptable There is nothing more hurtful to someone living with a disability then to open a new game to play with friends only to be blocked from even trying the game My close friend never feels handicaped in her daily life but these kind of things where accessibility is blatantly ignored for no reason are the ones that remind her of her condition and it s extremely hurtful I would love to have community support on this issue as well The resolution is very easy to implement for an issue that is preventing every gamers from enjoying the games they want to love Critical issue Rocket league is non accessible to quadraplegic players since the introduction of the forced introduction sequence,354,1664,2017

Fallout,Right now you have to precisely use your controller to manually move the cameras This makes it difficult and time consuming for most of us to make great videos That s really time consuming One important factor in the game s success is its Content Creators There s nothing like a new SunlessKhan video with great edits to get us amped up A revamped Replay Viewer that makes it easier to make Replays would create a marked improvement in that and help more people create quality shots It might also help creators like Sunless get more videos because it s easier to get the shot right the first time and have time for more content The method Many other games like EA s series I know NHL11 13 etc had it feature the ability to create keyframes where you set the camera s rotation and speed and it smoothly transitions and rotations between the two keyframes It also allowed you to adjust the speed at a keyframe in case the shot deserved a slowdown or something Once you have it like you want you could have the game render a video Something like this would really make Rocket League better If we could also have settings like Render at full settings and higher resolution so we don t have to stress our GPUs with real time rendering while capturing video possibly generating lag bad shots I m not saying to put any of this over major features and fixes like tournaments failing to load players in but it is one of the more solid quality of life updates we could use Feature Request Improved Replay Editor With Keyframes,278,1239,1516

Fallout,1 On console Xbox specifically to have the ability to search for items whether it be in your customize car menu or your manage inventory while party leader This is honestly an easy fix as the only reason you currently cant is because the cancel queue button is the same as the search NOT SURE IF IT IS LIKE THIS ON PS4 or SWITCH 2 Being able to trade in 5 Or however many mystery decal tournament rewards of one Say hades bomb to get the other one Like Nergal Honestly luck is crazy good for some and crazy bad for some others When epic came in they wanted to get rid of the aspect of gambling because of many reasons including laws But now people are gambling something more valuable than money they are gambling their time The outcome doesn t even have to be a painted version in fact I think it would be broken if you can get a painted one but whatever As for the problem of switching back and forth you can just put a property on it saying it can t be switched back over or something amp x200B 3 Copying presets If I ever want to have 2 identical presets with different wheels or for whatever reason this would be a great feature and I think the china version has it but not 100 percent sure on that 4 Making it possible to invite through parties on Xbox Im not exactly sure what the reason is behind the removal of this feature but it definitely is a lot harder now to trade and invite friends 5 Being able to search or filter out certain colours would be amazing Alternatively you can make collections and just do that I think an easier fix would be to filter out everything BUT archived items so you can just click that on and archive the stuff you love Other than favourites Some Quality Of Life Suggestions I came up with In Order Of Difficulty,337,1417,1753

Fallout,So I decided to try a ps5 controller about 20 days ago I have been gaming on Xbox One Controllers The I find the looks of the PS5 controller sexy af The controller would just keep losing its connection I liked the feel of the feel of the controller feels more natural and its material does not make my hand sweat as much as the XBO controller so did not mind playing wired My L2 had issues from beginning but it worked I mean its just reverse right Like I did not need it as much but I could tell there was something wrong Today I went to exchange it I have spent the last 2 hours troubleshooting with no luck I remember I had an old bluetooth adapter from like 2011 I took me 2 minutes to find it Surprisingly I found the driver online still Installed the driver disabled the built in bluetooth Restarted PC and when it came back started the pairing process Immediately notices that the adapter recognized the controller as a Game controller and not an HID component I smiled looked at the controller and it picked settings from my wired config Open up steam and control shows up there launched my favorite game and it works So if you are having issues with built ins I would suggest getting a separate adapter Idk what would cause this issue The adapter I have I know it has at least Bluetooth 2 0 the built in on the mobo should be 5 0 I believe What is your experience with PS5 controller and Bluetooth connections What are you using a built in or adapter What version of Bluetooth dies your solution use PS5 controller did not work with built in bluetooth on BF 550 I mobo,300,1278,1577

RocketLeague,Yes I fully understand that the F1 DLC is far from ready and obtainable but I m sensing a perfect opportunity for Psyonix to inject one of my favorite sport s theme songs into the game written by Bryan Tyler This is the full track in case you are unfamiliar with the song watch v KTETwgQnbsQ It kind of has that SARPBC Anthem vibes to it so I had an idea that if F1 gave them the licensing to do the car they might a well package the Theme song in the deal As for how they could chop up the song so it s ideal for a anthem I m thinking the high energy sections either the part about 20 seconds into the clip or the Fanfare near the 2min 30sec mark I am fully aware that many here don t like the idea of more Anthems but they are most likely here to stay and I personally would love to cruise through this game with this theme as my preset Anthem Of course I could also just do with the song being added to the in game radio but let me know your thoughts below I would include NASCAR theme as another option but I don t follow NASCAR so I have no idea if they even have an anthem P View Poll poll mg7cf4 Can we get a F1 Theme music as a F1 DLC Anthem,239,911,1149

RocketLeague,My brother thinks that Closer is a better anthem than Breathing Underwater I said that Closer just sounds like a background song you would hear in a club and not a good anthem It s not as exciting and bumping as Breathing Underwater when you score a goal or get MVP So this is dependent on whether or not it is anthem worthy not based on the song it self View Poll poll mg5cge Which of the two anthems is better,81,331,411

RocketLeague,Today Richard Lewis joined the G2 broadcast to cast their games over the spring split This has caught the criticism of many Twitter users who want to cancel him and want him out of these scene The purpose of this post is to hi light just some of the work he has done throughout his career and force you to consider if it is really worth cancelling him over Twitter arguments Throughout his career as an esports journalist Richard Lewis has been involved with games like CSGO Overwatch and League of Legends His work has done nothing but try to better every one of those scenes He has exposed countless people organizations and companies who have tried and succeeded at taking advantage of players fans and the sport itself His actions have always reflected his integrity and his integrity defines him as a person He is never afraid to speak his mind no matter who he is talking to or the power they have To show this I want to share just some of the work he s done over his tenure as an Esports Journalist In 2015 he exposed match fixing at the highest level of the Counter Strike professional scene petition https youtu be u1DvEO2KaK0 These are just two instances but there are many more examples of him calling out cheaters Now consider the damage this does to an esports scene How can fans and viewers enjoy a match when in the back of their head they know it is legitimately scripted When someone cheats or throws a match it literally costs players their future or fans their money It is extremely detrimental to the scene as a whole In 2016 he exposed ProSyndicate and Tmartn for advertising their own gambling website where they controlled the odds and could manipulate them in their favor in order to make their website more appealing to their fans general news richard lewis discusses tmartns latest venture a pyramid scheme 10960 Aside from taking gross advantage of their fans this was a violation of FTC guidelines and the literal FTC settled a case against them and reviewed their guidelines for online gambling Who does this protect A young impressionable audience who frequent those websites In 2018 and since he was one of the very few journalists who published articles and call out Riot Games for their company culture in which sexual harassment was a common occurrence for female employees pany culture In 2020 he called out a popular Brazilian team for multiple homophobic comments taking advantage of their fans and cheating https youtu be jhi3A jM2pM He has repeatedly called out tournament organizers for not paying their players or employees when those people are in a position to get blacklisted if they speak out He s also helped prevent many new players from being taken advantage by helping reviewing their contracts and offering proper resources He s not afraid to call out teams or players either when they are taking advantage of their fans This is what he does So now with all that in mind consider this will having him in Rocket League esports benefit or hinder the scene Everything that he has done so far has been to keep the esports scene heathy and away from bad faith actors His biggest critics are fans of the teams or companies he s criticized which is extremely ironic when they re usually the ones being taken advantage of The biggest criticisms of him are that he blocks people on Twitter and uses hyperboles Is THAT it That is what should stop him from being involved with the Rocket League scene Doesn t that seem ridiculous Look at his track record and think about how he will benefit the future of Rocket League esports and stop it from becoming a cesspool for corruption Richard Lewis absolutely belongs in Esports and we would be so lucky to have him be a part of Rocket League s future,663,3072,3734

RocketLeague,Hi fellow comrades I have a bit of an issue with xbox controllers and I am a bit tired of replacing mine every 3 6 months I am a bit hard on my controllers and that s part of the issue but Im wondering if any of you know a durable alternative as a controller For the most part the problems with my controller start with stick drift issue from either right or left joystick depending on the game I play but mostly Rocket League I have own multiples Xbox controller over the years but since I play Rocket League a Xbox Elite series 1 which didn t last at all probably 3 4 months top and 2 Power A Spectra including one I recently changed back in October 2020 The last one I got is still in pretty good shape except for my left joystick which automaticly goes up for no reason thanks to Modern Warfare s tactical sprint Nevertheless whenever I try to aerial with this controller I immediatly fall as my defect joystick makes the front of my car dips down or flip cancel when I backflip So I now play with a less crucial defected controller that makes my air roll mostly inconsistent At this point I pretty tired of replacing my controller that often and Im looking for a better solution I am aware that the pressure I put on my controller is probably too high and im looking forwards to change my method although I still want to put every chances on my side by purchasing a more durable controller However my research were a bit difficult especially since players don t experiment the same issues For my part it is mainly about stick drift issues from joystick Therefore I am looking for a compatible PC controller that gives me the ability to have at least two more customizable buttons with of course a durable build I prefer the Xbox controller layout but I am not close to using a Playstation one I don t know if a Scuf controller would be worth or if the Xbox Elite controller is really a durable controller with whom I just had a bad luck Any recommandation of controllers help me a ton Plus any strategies to reduce stress on controllers or even reduce the in game influence of a deffect controller would be greatly appreciated Thanks a lot in advance Mighty Clee Durable PC controller,409,1781,2189

RocketLeague,Hey guys Brand new to the game Me and my friends started playing RL about a month ago and we are all in gold division and are out here sweatin to win our first tournament Except the last 3 4 tournaments we have played we have played smurfs every single time I m talking platinum and diamond tournament winners in our gold division bracket Can somebody explain the logic behind this Do people just get absolutely bodied in their own tournaments so hard that they have to lower their rank to ruin the fun of people in lower ranks Do they get certain rewards I ve also ran into tons of diamond plat tournament winners in ranked who will go up on us 5 1 and then just forfeit the game with a few seconds left Is this something that is fairly common I m new here but why are there so many smurfs in tournaments,156,650,805

RocketLeague,Note These are suggestions that I think the community would like either fixed or added Note this is all on Epic Games and might be for other platforms if they are needed or are an issue on other platforms as well Please consider these Obvious 1 Ranking System teaming This one people love debating so don t get mad if you disagree If we lose a rank when getting harder people the team can make a way for it to be a little harder to lose the ranks I ve noticed it s easy to lose your ranks if you get unlucky with people that are better with the same rank A more complex ranking system Match you with people more your skill level Rather then rank level That would make it more fair in my own opinion 2 Ai Bots There s tons of mods out there making the bots have more capabilities If they were more complex they would help players build skill Maybe team up with one of the teams working on complex Ai for rocket League That would help a lot of people I think it would help the players that have to be offline also Have a more variety of hard easy bots 3 Better map mod support I have installed mods before it does take a bit of effort to install mods If the team could try and find a way to add better mod support for the current mods and future mods It would be greatly appreciated Smaller 1 The profile picture for Rocket League Epic Games There s no way to have a profile picture on Epic games besides using mods It kind of takes away from the immersive part Since now it s just a empty spot It would be awesome to have this simple feature I have no clue in designing games so I m not sure how hard of a fix this would be but I wouldn t think it would be too hard 2 The built in vc I noticed that this was usable when the steam version was still around But in the Epic Games version it s still there even though there s no way to use it from what I ve seen I m suggesting either remove it or make it useable again Please take these in consideration with the Team I would love if these features could either be fixed or added If the team adds these I bet everyone would be super appreciative I hope people agree We need these fixes Thank you Wooostershire Rocket League Suggestions Add Debated,436,1758,2193

RocketLeague,So I m quite new to this game played a bit several years ago maybe a couple of hours in total but only took it up again 2 5 months ago I m in Gold 3 div 4 in 2v2 and on a brink of enetering Platinum But lo and behold every f ing time me and my teammate get to the match we have to win to rank up we end up playing with two unranked players who are obviously smurfs Random names plain cars no decals boosts nothing And they kick our asses with several goals in difference Also when playing 3v3 and we re on a brink of a rank up to Plat there is always one guy on our team that is unranked and should be a bronze like I only installed this game a day ago bronze Does this happen to others If yes WTF Why It is so god damn frustrating I ve never seen matching system worse than this Even games like LoL have a better matching system Sometime I feel like it s impossible to rank if your skill is tier 1 division 2 of the rank above What is up with the matching system,203,761,963
RocketLeague,I know this is nothing to brag about but after constant yo yoing from low plat to the edge of Diamond I finally did it I mostly play doubles and solo queue I ve always played mega casually but recently started playing more often and it s so rewarding to set a goal and reach it I ve watched a tonne of YT on how to improve and learning new stuff like half flip has really helped even if it is basic I still suck at a lot of stuff like off the walls but my overall play has gotten so much better This felt unreachable before but onwards and upwards hopefully Finally hit Diamond,115,463,577

RocketLeague,Hi I have a question and i could use some help Before the F2P update i have played RL both on PS4 and PC MY PC was not very good back then so when it broke and i needed to fix it i played on PS4 I like trading a lot so i did that on both platforms This resulted in a nice amount of now credits To be very clear i earned all credits on seperate platforms And that is where my problem begins Because of the shared inventory i can use all the items i have on both platforms But the credits are just very weird I am maining PC so I thought i d buy an item from my leftover credits on PS4 so i could use it on pc So I did and logged on to my PC and noticed that i lost the amount of credits I spent on my PS4 And i just dont get it The amount of credits is different on both platforms Credits dont add on the other platform they only disappear I hope someone can help me with this or knows how this happens English is not my first language so if anything is unclear Please let me know My credits,211,780,990

RocketLeague,This player my team mate left the game with around a minute and a half to go as we were 4 goals down just as the game timer was on 1 to 2 seconds left his name popped up as re joining and completely avoided the punishment they would ve otherwise gotten from leaving half way through the game I know they avoided the cooldown punishment as I played with them again the very next game which I started the queue for as soon as the game ended This type of behaviour only justifies their toxicity as they are purposely ruining other players experiences while also avoiding the systems method of trying to combat toxicity As said in the title it undermines a system to prevent toxicity toxic players are bad enough as is but when they find ways to cheat the system it incentivises them to continue being like this as they know they aren t punished https preview redd it fo4g87s78zp61 jpg width 1920 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s f3f133722852d59ca0e37d430f0a95db8dec7b9f https preview redd it har0p0698zp61 jpg width 1920 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 451cd8680b4f529ca2b850479705986ef07496db https preview redd it 5lmj59r98zp61 jpg width 1920 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s cf693e925464bb847a79e9a64cb973e1d52b1202 amp x200B https preview redd it mgc0q57hazp61 jpg width 1920 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s f626d4a34661979d8a8afdf0d76bb559a2de1cd1 Today I encountered a player who left a game in ranked only for them to re join at the last second to avoid a ban this clearly undermines rocket league s attempts to punish players who make it unfair for others Can the rules be changed somehow to prevent this,278,1346,1623

RocketLeague,Over the last few months I ve come across several epic accounts in Champ that have a Bronze Silver or Gold Season 1 Season 2 Tournament winner title amp nbsp There is no amount of toxicity that can top this total disrespect of new players Why do people put so much time in the game just to screw over players that are just starting out You first need to play casual level up and then purposefully lose your placement matches in order to be able to play a Bronze tournament amp nbsp I have reported those players for unsportsmanlike conduct but nothing ever comes from that I really wish Psyonix would expand the report option or actively monitor for MMR behavior like this amp nbsp I realize it s difficult to prevent this but it just really pisses me off Psyonix please,142,629,770

RocketLeague,Like many other rocketeers I would love to hit some of the clips I see from higher ranks youtubers I picked up the game when it went F2P in September and got hooked I ve watched plenty of tutorials on aerial car control but always wanted to know how long it takes to get to different mechanical checkpoints to give me more motivation to practice so I figured I would document this for myself and others to look back and see where I came from My general philosophy try to use uncomfortable mechanics in game you will screw up but learn much faster than being totally safe I also prefer training packs to get an idea of how to execute a shot before trying to set them up myself in freeplay As of today 3 28 here are my stats 275 hours Diamond 1 Here are the mechanics I know and how I got there Half Flip watched a youtube video and practiced for 5 mins in training then use as much as possible in game Easy to see results in rotations and saves Speed Flip watched this watch v mfCecDIaJE4 youtube video which I found to be much easier than other tutorials Practice for 20 mins in training then use a lot in game BEWARE you WILL this up in game often so your teammates will rage I find speed flips more useful for getting around recoveries than for kickoffs Air Dribble I can push the ball in the air if I get the setup right 50 of the time still not good at holding the ball up This will become easier I m guessing once I can twist in the air I ve spent 5 hours in training total practicing these shots Fast Aerial I am confident in my fast aerial shots which helped me get to diamond This takes some aerial training practice couple hours after watching Kevpert s tutorial here watch v eAO1sqr135c After feeling confident in just getting a quicker touch on the ball you should be able to beat most plats to the ball and keep pressure up even with mostly inaccurate touches Dribbles Flicks This is my favorite to practice because I can set them up really quick in freeplay Flicks have been key to me ranking up since I can now set them up quick enough to not get dunked I first learned to dribble by using bakkes mod to get the ball on top of my car up on d pad and using the wall to hold the ball up Once I m comfortable I practice keeping the ball up and driving around Spent probably 5 hours total practicing between matches or just 10 mins here and there If you want a break from training 1s is great to practice ground play What I m working on Aerial Car Control Kuxir Twist Air roll during aerials This makes little sense to my brain so I can t really use it in game and just flail around in freeplay So I m practicing each aerial direction at a time doing pro aerial training First I run through all 10 shots upside down Then I replay alternating normal fast aerial upside down I ve reran these 10 shots probably 10 times now and can see definite improvement Up next will be doing this on each side which I m confident will help me revisit learning the Kuxir twist Ceiling Shots I spent about an hour using training packs and am super inconsistent Don t have enough of a feel to try in game but opponents who can hit these fairly consistently usually beat me in diamond ranks I feel like I should revisit this after I have better aerial control Ground to air dribble I can sometimes get these right but can very rarely set them up right in game Only scored 1 or 2 in match ever Big skill gap between training packs dropping a perfect setup and the bounces you see in game Lower ranks have weaker hits resulting in small bounces too so it s hard to try in match Rotations I m good at rotating back post and speedflips have helped with my recoveries Sometimes I feel like my rotations take me out of the play and I have a hard time balancing rotating getting boost staying relevant I ll keep feeling this one out Thanks for reading if this is interesting to you If you re a mechanical god compared to me feel free to drop tips or carry me in 2s with advice Documenting my mechanics progression,770,3227,3996

RocketLeague,Hey all Recently this weird issue I ve been having lately has been happening much more frequently I play a good amount of games typically around 5 10 and then suddenly my controls feel very unresponsive when handling the car Once it happens I ve yet to figure out a way to fix it I always just quit playing and next time I play the game a day or hours later it seems to be fine again for about the same amount of time I can almost positively say it s not actual controller input lag I watch my controllers ping with DS4Windows and it s constantly at 1 2ms Plus it doesn t actually feel like input lag because the wheels turn exactly when I want them to it s more like the controls are just limited More specifically the wheels respond to my controller inputs as fast as I perform them but the car just finishes the input slower or doesn t respond completely to the input Ultimately this results in me having a MUCH wider turn radius than I should normally have and general car control is sluggish feeling Other symptoms is the game sometimes feels like it s running at 90 gamespeed for a brief second which further implies to me that it s not a controller issue and actually a game issue It s worth noting this has happened to me before I switched to PS5 controller as well I had 2 Xbox One controllers and the same thing would happen as well Would immensely appreciate if someone has gone through this before and knows of a fix Help troubleshooting some random input lag PC Steam PS5 Controller,283,1213,1495

RocketLeague,Hi I m so angry at this game right now I get anywhere from 12 30 ping when I play on US east servers PC and I still lag all the time The best way to describe this lag is my car will randomly translate to one side or the other and it will make me miss the ball Or sometimes I ll flip and the flip will stutter like go in slow motion and all wonky It makes it so hard for me to play because it makes me not able to rely on my mechanics so I m forced to play much more passive I m D3 at the moment but I feel like I would easily be champ if I could depend on myself to hit the ball Any help troubleshooting this would be appreciated thanks p s I m on college campus wifi so I can t reset the router or anything of that sort Also the game almost never gives me the packet loss symbol or any of the other lagging symbols but I m certain that I m lagging When I play in free play it s smooth and I can do all sorts of things that I can t do in game because of this lag Help troubleshooting lag with low ping,219,783,1001

RocketLeague,My 10 year old just won his first silver tournament and it was one hell of a rush for me as a spectator Right now he s still trying to return to earth again while the last dregs of adrenaline is leaving his system But first a bit of backstory He was an avid Fortnite player mainly because that s what all his classmates were and are playing but he has steadily grown tired of the game itself and the negative energy the game somehow manages to stir in him and his friends Half a year or so ago we downloaded Rocket League and played it for a bit together It didn t really do much for me though so we just played it sporadically in order to play something together During the last months he s been playing it more and more by himself which has sadly resulted in him frequently begin bullied by a group of kids from his class who apparently will do their utmost to trash the game and everyone who plays it because well it isn t Fortnite My kid tries to ignore it which is tough and his general mood has definitely suffered from it We re in touch with his teachers and hopefully it will be resolved sooner rather than later Anyhow I have followed his progress from the sidelines and while I don t really know much about the game it s obvious that he s getting better and better Lately he has started to enroll in tournaments and has managed to get to second and third round a couple of times which he was pretty stoked about Today he registered again and he asked me to watch his first game They had a very equal first game which went down the wire and it was obvious that his two teammates were pretty damn awesome Aside from playing well they were super nice and friendly cheering everyone on and giving encouragement even after going behind They edged the match in OT and went on to battle their way into the semis Here they lost the first of three and were down by two in the second with just 60 sec on the clock The kid was pretty downbeat by now as one of the goals was his fault as he had botched what should have been an easy save His two teammates continued to encourage him in chat though and they scored two in quick succession to level the score with a few seconds to go They rode the wave of positivity to tie the series 1 1 and eventually win the decider My kid was a shambles of nerves but in the short interlude before the final we talked about how cool it was to actually reach a final for the first time and what a great overall experience it had been with these teammates They lost their first finals match played a super tight second which was won in OT and then went on to sweep the last match 4 1 My kid was needless to say nothing short of extatic and he spent much of the second part of the last match where they were up by 3 talking about how much he would have to thank his teammates if they would eventually win When all was said and done the chat was a flurry of GGs and That was fun including from all three of his opponents which was amazing to see I have played MANY competitive online games where chat instead would have been chock full of gloating and negativity after a final like this so I was super surprised and glad to see such positivity Anyhow pardon my ramble but I just wanted to voice my appreciation for a handful of players who hopefully are somewhat representative of your community as a whole My kid had a brilliant time and will no doubt keep gunning for higher ranks and perhaps eventually higher tiers of tournaments as well A wholesome experience,674,2821,3494

RocketLeague,Like many other rocketeers I would love to hit some of the clips I see from higher ranks youtubers  I picked up the game when it went F2P in September and got hooked  I ve watched plenty of tutorials on aerial car control  but always wanted to know how long it takes to get to different mechanical  checkpoints  to give me more motivation to practice  so I figured I would document this for myself and others to look back and see where I came from  My general philosophy   try to use uncomfortable mechanics in game  you will screw up but learn much faster than being totally safe  I also prefer training packs to get an idea of how to execute a shot before trying to set them up myself in freeplay                                As of today  3 28  here are my stats  275 hours  Diamond 1                                 Here are the mechanics I know and how I got there      Half Flip    watched a youtube video and practiced for 5 mins in training  then use as much as possible in game  Easy to see results in rotations and saves    Speed Flip    watched  this   watch v mfCecDIaJE4  youtube video which I found to be much easier than other tutorials  Practice for 20 mins in training then use a lot in game  BEWARE you WILL          this up in game often so your teammates will rage  I find speed flips more useful for getting around recoveries than for kickoffs    Air Dribble    I can push the ball in the air if I get the setup right    50  of the time   still not good at holding the ball up  This will become easier I m guessing once I can twist in the air  I ve spent   5 hours in training total practicing these shots    Fast Aerial    I am confident in my fast aerial shots which helped me get to diamond  This takes some aerial training practice  couple hours  after watching Kevpert s tutorial  here   watch v eAO1sqr135c   After feeling confident in just getting a quicker touch on the ball you should be able to beat most plats to the ball and keep pressure up  even with mostly inaccurate touches    Dribbles Flicks    This is my favorite to practice because I can set them up really quick in freeplay  Flicks have been key to me ranking up since I can now set them up quick enough to not get dunked  I first learned to dribble by using bakkes mod to get the ball on top of my car  up on d pad  and using the wall to hold the ball up  Once I m comfortable I practice keeping the ball up and driving around  Spent probably 5 hours total practicing between matches or just 10 mins here and there  If you want a break from training  1s is great to practice ground play                                  What I m working on      Aerial Car Control    Kuxir Twist Air roll during aerials  This makes little sense to my brain so I can t really use it in game and just flail around in freeplay  So I m practicing each aerial direction at a time doing pro aerial training  First I run through all 10 shots upside down  Then I replay alternating normal fast aerial upside down  I ve reran these 10 shots probably 10 times now and can see definite improvement  Up next will be doing this on each side which I m confident will help me revisit learning the Kuxir twist    Ceiling Shots    I spent about an hour using training packs and am super inconsistent  Don t have enough of a feel to try in game  but opponents who can hit these fairly consistently usually beat me in diamond ranks  I feel like I should revisit this after I have better aerial control    Ground to air dribble    I can sometimes get these right  but can very rarely set them up right in game  Only scored 1 or 2 in match ever  Big skill gap between training packs dropping a perfect setup and the bounces you see in game  Lower ranks have weaker hits  resulting in small bounces  too so it s hard to try in match    Rotations    I m good at rotating back post and speedflips have helped with my recoveries  Sometimes I feel like my rotations take me out of the play and I have a hard time balancing rotating getting boost staying relevant  I ll keep feeling this one out                                Thanks for reading if this is interesting to you  If you re a mechanical god compared to me feel free to drop tips or carry me in 2s with advice  Documenting my mechanics progression,1034,3227,4260

RocketLeague,Hey all   Recently this weird issue I ve been having lately has been happening much more frequently  I play a good amount of games  typically around 5 10  and then suddenly my controls feel very unresponsive when handling the car  Once it happens I ve yet to figure out a way to fix it  I always just quit playing and next time I play the game a day or hours later it seems to be fine again for about the same amount of time   I can almost positively say it s not actual controller input lag  I watch my controllers ping with DS4Windows and it s constantly at 1 2ms  Plus it doesn t actually feel like input lag because the wheels turn exactly when I want them to  it s more like the controls are just limited  More specifically  the wheels respond to my controller inputs as fast as I perform them  but the car just finishes the input slower or doesn t respond completely to the input   Ultimately this results in me having a MUCH wider turn radius than I should normally have and general car control is sluggish feeling  Other symptoms is the game sometimes feels like it s running at 90  gamespeed for a brief second  which further implies to me that it s not a controller issue  and actually a game issue  It s worth noting this has happened to me before I switched to PS5 controller as well  I had 2 Xbox One controllers and the same thing would happen as well  Would immensely appreciate if someone has gone through this before and knows of a fix  Help troubleshooting some random  input lag   PC   Steam   PS5 Controller ,316,1213,1528

RocketLeague,I hope this helps  I have been having issues in rocket league where I would randomly disconnect from matches while never having any lag  just instant disconnects  After talking with my isp  hard wiring my connection etc  no solutions  I found this article   ps4 keeps disconnecting from wi fi   and it solved my issue  My router supports dual bands and the default setting on PS4 is to auto select between the two causing a short lapse in connectivity  but enough to get tossed out of matches  Selecting one or the other  2 4 or 5GHz  prevents the console from auto switching between either band  So far it s only been 2 days but I have not disconnected once  where I would disconnect at least 2 3 times an hour  This was extremely frustrating getting banned and dropping rank  I swore up and down it was at amp t but so far this works  Hope it helps at least someone  Rocket League and PS4 disconnecting issues,186,726,911

RocketLeague,Hi I m so angry at this game right now  I get anywhere from 12 30 ping when I play on US east servers  PC   and I still lag all the time  The best way to describe this lag is my car will randomly translate to one side or the other and it will make me miss the ball  Or sometimes  I ll flip  and the flip will stutter   like go in slow motion and all wonky   It makes it so hard for me to play because it makes me not able to rely on my mechanics so I m forced to play much more passive  I m D3 at the moment but I feel like I would easily be champ if I could depend on myself to hit the ball  Any help troubleshooting this would be appreciated  thanks  p s  I m on college campus wifi so I can t reset the router or anything of that sort  Also  the game almost never gives me the  packet loss  symbol or any of the other lagging symbols  but I m certain that I m lagging  When I play in free play it s smooth and I can do all sorts of things that I can t do in game because of this lag  Help troubleshooting lag with low ping,243,783,1025

RocketLeague,So last season I never got my drops because I didnt play quite enough to fully get them all done and it ended up being I had one challenge that I just couldnt grind out in time and so that was fine  but this season I told myself I would grind out the seasonal challenge drops and so I did  However over the last few days as I ve been finishing up the challenges I needed to do to get the drops I noticed that I only had 20 out of 22 and now I have 21 out of 22  but if I am correct there are 6 free challenges per stage and I have completed all but 2 of those challenges  So I think unless my math and logic is just completely wrong then rocket league bugged and screwed me over for my challenges  This wouldnt be a problem if I was actually good at the game and i could grind out the last two challenges but its frustrated me to the point I dont want to give my time to something that could possibly bug again and not give me any drops at all and the only two challenges I have left is getting 100 saves and one isnt even half way done while the other is 86 100 but I dont feel that I should need to have to grind that   TLDR  rocket league is shit game  season challenges are dumb and screwed me over  Rocket league screwed me over,263,971,1233

RocketLeague,My 10 year old just won his first silver tournament  and it was one hell of a rush for me as a spectator  Right now he s still trying to return to earth again while the last dregs of adrenaline is leaving his system   But first a bit of backstory    He was an avid Fortnite player  mainly because that s what all his classmates were and are playing  but he has steadily grown tired of the game itself and the negative energy the game somehow manages to stir in him and his friends  Half a year or so ago we downloaded Rocket League and played it for a bit together  It didn t really do much for me  though  so we just played it sporadically in order to play something together  During the last months he s been playing it more and more by himself  which has sadly resulted in him frequently begin bullied by a group of kids from his class  who apparently will do their utmost to trash the game and everyone who plays it  because    well  it isn t Fortnite  My kid tries to ignore it  which is tough  and his general mood has definitely suffered from it  We re in touch with his teachers  and hopefully it will be resolved sooner rather than later   Anyhow  I have followed his progress from the sidelines  and while I don t really know much about the game  it s obvious that he s getting better and better  Lately he has started to enroll in tournaments and has managed to get to second and third round a couple of times  which he was pretty stoked about  Today he registered again  and he asked me to watch his first game  They had a very equal first game which went down the wire  and it was obvious that his two teammates were pretty damn awesome  Aside from playing well  they were super nice and friendly cheering everyone on and giving encouragement even after going behind  They edged the match in OT and went on to battle their way into the semis  Here they lost the first of three and were down by two in the second with just 60 sec on the clock  The kid was pretty downbeat by now as one of the goals was his fault  as he had botched what should have been an easy save  His two teammates continued to encourage him in chat  though  and they scored two in quick succession to level the score with a few seconds to go  They rode the wave of positivity to tie the series 1 1 and eventually win the decider  My kid was a shambles of nerves  but in the short interlude before the final  we talked about how cool it was to actually reach a final for the first time and what a great overall experience it had been with these teammates  They lost their first finals match  played a super tight second which was won in OT and then went on to sweep the last match 4 1  My kid was needless to say nothing short of extatic and he spent much of the second part of the last match where they were up by 3 talking about how much he would have to thank his teammates if they would eventually win  When all was said and done the chat was a flurry of GGs and  That was fun     including from all three of his opponents  which was amazing to see  I have played MANY competitive online games  where chat instead would have been chock full of gloating and negativity after a final like this  so I was super surprised and glad to see such positivity   Anyhow  pardon my ramble  but I just wanted to voice my appreciation for a handful of players who hopefully are somewhat representative of your community as a whole  My kid had a brilliant time and will no doubt keep gunning for higher ranks and perhaps eventually higher tiers of tournaments as well  A wholesome experience,743,2821,3563

RocketLeague,Why do people feel the need to bad mouth your own teammates when they make a mistake  I feel like it doesn t help the team  probably makes the teammate you re bad mouthing play worse or not even want to play better because you re being an asshole  Everyone makes mistakes and you re being a hypocrite pointing out the same mistakes you make occasionally  They know what they did wrong  Stop kicking them while they re down and killing the team vibe  Although It does seem like it s always the worst player that ends up quitting that s doing the talking  I swear I would turn the chat completely off if I didn t need it to communicate to the team productively  It s just a game meant for FUN    CHILL lol Why bad mouth your own team ,153,580,732
