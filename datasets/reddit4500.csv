1,boardgames,"I was reading the comments on a Brothers Murph video.  Someone posted ""there are mechanics I love and some I haaaaaate"" .  That got me wondering if I hated any mechanics.

There are some I like more than others but I couldn't think of any I hate.  The only one I had a problem with multiple times was trading resources. There have been times when a ""couple"" would make really unfair trades with each other. It was obvious the female was trading to make her husband happy.  Fortunately I am good enough friends with them to point this out. I even found a short podcast on this subject and played it for them. The term they used was ""lioning"".

But I believe this was instances of people abusing/not playing as intended not the mechanic.

I have a friends wife that refuses to play auction games. I just don't get it. Why? I'm guessing it's because she's not good at it.

17,boardgames,"I'll be the first to admit that game has its flaws. And I also understand that, like many games, it's simply just not going to be for everyone. But in my admittedly limited experience, I haven't found many games that I enjoy quite as much. Here are the reasons I personally love it, and why many people probably won't. 

*1. Balance:*

*Why it's good:*

This is a tricky one, because of the plethora of house rules that many people consider necessary to enjoy the game, but in general, the closer you stick to the rules as written, the more you realize just how impeccably balanced this game can be. In a challenging encounter, you're almost always balanced on a knife's edge of success and failure. The choices you make each turn can have significant effects on how easy or how difficult the encounter is, and how many resources you wind up using to defeat it.

*Why it's bad:*

Even with its (in my opinion) impeccable balance, the game has its flaws. The item deck and the inherent repetitiveness get old quickly, and this is where house rules come in. But many of the popular house rules I see can inherently throw off the balance and chances of failure, typically in the favor of the players. This difficulty of modifying the game to be ""more fun"" while maintaining the knife's edge balance means that this game can be incredibly tricky to house rule properly while maintaining the intended level of challenge. 
 

*2. Difficulty*

*Why it's good:*

The knife's edge of success and failure means one thing. You will almost certainly fail at some point. Possibly quite frequently.  This very real chance of failure adds a massive level of tension to many decisions and moments throughout the game. I love it, because I don't want my success to be handed to me. I want to earn it by learning from mistakes and failures. 

*Why it's bad:*

Dying and having to start back at the bonfire can feel especially unfun and unrewarding to many players. It's an unfortunate side effect of the challenge of the game and the Dark Souls formula it's built upon. This is perhaps one of the primary reasons this game simply isn't going to be for everyone. If you're not someone that's ok with ""feels bad failure"" then you're just not going to enjoy this game as it was made to be experienced. 


*3. The Dice*

*Why it's good:*

While there is some randomness in the dice rolling element, this simply means that on each turn, you need to be weighing the probability and cost of a bad roll, and make your decisions accordingly. Often times it's simply a better decision for the dodge focused character to try to block a hit, because a poor roll on the block will leave you standing, but a failed dodge will kill you. This number crunching based strategy is something I personally enjoy quite a bit. 

*Why it's bad:*

I see many people complain that the dice add too much randomness into the game. I would argue that it's not simply pure randomness, it's probability. However, many people aren't the type who are going to enjoy calculating and weighing the  probabilities and costs of success or failure on each turn for each of their choices. So if you're the type of person who just dislikes the ""randomness of dice"" then you probably won't enjoy this game very much. 


*4. Simplicity*

*Why it's good:*

While the game certainly can't be considered ""simple"" I've found that the rules are incredibly quick and easy to pick up. Getting someone started and understanding just about every element they need to to properly play takes easily less than 20 minutes. And I was even capable of running the game myself after playing it twice without ever having to look at the rule book. For my tastes, this is an almost necessary component for a game to be enjoyable. I hate being bogged down by overwhelming number of rules and rule complexity. 

*Why it's bad:*

If you want complex, or if you want a clear and concisely written, well organized rulebook to sink your teeth into, then this game is not for you. The rulebook's organization is probably the single most frustrating aspect of the game. On the rare occasion that you do need to look up a ruling, good luck finding it. 

*The verdict:*

Overall I think the game succeeds quite well in what it sets out to be, but that success does come at a cost. And the game itself is not without its flaws. The repetitiveness, the item deck, and the rulebook stand out as the top three to me. These issues can be mitigated with proper house rules, but maintaining the balance and challenge while incorporating custom rules is difficult. 

If you want a game that's primarily focused on balance and difficulty, then this game just might be for you. On the other hand, if you want a fun, dungeon delving, blast through your enemies with fireballs and awesome attacks type of experience, this game is going to feel incredibly inferior to other options out there, because that's simply not what it is trying to be.","Dark Souls The Board Game.

20,boardgames,"So I recently got the Dominion Alchemy expansion, purchased sight unseen from a friend who was liquidating. When I finally received it and started looking through it the following cards were missing:
10 each of the “familiar”, “herbalist”, “philosophers stone”, and “university cards, and the 16 “potion” and 12 randomizer cards. I imagine they accidentally got packed up with her copy of the base game and were sold off in an earlier sale.

My friend apologized and refunded, but are the rest of the cards worth keeping and incorporating into the base game? I haven’t pulled down the rule book and read through it yet so didn’t know if the others (alchemist, apothecary, apprentice, golem, possession, scrying pool, transmute, and vineyard) can be incorporated without the missing potion cards.

25,boardgames,"To start, I absolutely love Bullet\[heart\] and think it's brilliant in design, art direction, and execution. I highly recommend it to anyone who seems remotely interested, I've already played it a bunch and even bought a copy for a friend. So, when it was announced there would be a character pack already releasing soon I was quite excited! Then I saw the characters in [Bullet\[orange\]](https://www.level99store.com/pages/bullet-orange)... and I'm really having a hard time not feeling uncomfortable about the character's art design or, at worst, put-off from the whole franchise as a whole.

I have almost no problem with the representation in the base game, and in fact champion the game for doing its part in helping to balance gender representation in board games. In general, I think L99 games do a decent job at tasteful representation - though there are some abhorrent exceptions to this rule (practically the whole Season 1 of Exceed).

While I have no problem with an expansion featuring only younger heroines (like many in the base game), I can’t say the same thing when the two youngest characters, Shugiri and QP, 14-year-old girls, are both drawn with comically short skirts that cut-off just below their waists, skin showing on their upper thighs. It feels gratuitous, this detail drawn in a way that appeals to the male gaze, which is especially inappropriate given they’re underage.

I then did a quick google search of the game's artist, UsanekoRin, and the fact that he’s drawing stuff that appears to be sexualize an underage girl - which I won't link to here - makes me feel gross.

When I brought this up on the discord most people responded that, for anime, it's pretty tame, which misses the point. I'm not trying to argue that it is explicit for an anime, but that, viewed in a vacuum, it is a strange choice to have two 14-year-old girls, drawn by a man, in a game made by all men, wearing skirts that could literally not be any shorter without showing underwear.

To me, L99 are shooting themselves in the foot and limiting the broad appeal of this game, which is otherwise HUGE - the design is easy to learn, fun to play, vibrant and exciting. I think they have a case of tunnel vision when trying to appeal to their core fan base, which is probably a bunch of anime fans that don't mind this sort of thing, when they could appeal to practically the whole board gaming community because the design is so strong in every other aspect.

 **Today**, thanks to the feedback and support of its community of players, Clash of Deck takes off with a new edition, available in English. The game will have more conventional components, such as ""real"" cards, larger and of better quality, with a tuck box.

74,boardgames,"This post isn't in meant in any way to insult Lovecraft works or those who enjoy it. It's just an observation after only playing board games for a year or so. 

As someone who's always been pretty deep into movies,  tv shows,  video games,  books,  and general pop culture, lovecraft works have always been present but fairly niche. You'd see  a video game or movie with Cthulhu-like monster designs but that was about it.  In recent years there's been a significant uptick in all forms of media  like call of cthulhu,  Lovecraft country, color of outer space,  and more. It's definitely gotten bigger but I'd say it's still relatively niche in mainstream pop culture.

This isn't the case at all  in board games.  You see people talking everyday about Arkham Horror LCG, Arkham Horror board game,  Eldritch Horror,  Cthulhu Death May Die,  Mansions of Madness, and more.  This doesn't even include the non Cthulhu games where he makes an appearance. I read every other day of people who are entering the hobby and asking for Lovecraft games because they love the theme so much.  Again,  this isn't a knock against the people who enjoy them, but i just find it unusual that i rarely see people asking for book, movie, tv show,  or video games about Lovecraft. 

Is there something about board games that particularly shines in adapting these works?  Has it always been this way or is it just a recent trend?",Why are board games obsessed with lovecraft? Is it a recent trend?

80,boardgames,"Hey folks maybe this is an r/relationship post but I figure this community might have some good answers on this.  I have a friend who is a real bummer when the game stops going his way.  Not always but often enough to be a problem.  

 It tends to go one of two ways.  Either he starts complaining about the game, how it's unfair, the choices aren't good and had no way of winning (its the games fault I'm losing vibe) or, worse, its a string of harassing annoying questions by forcing some linguistic ambiguity of a rule.  Not sure how to explain that one but as an example, in Descent JITD 2e, he challenged my use of a card because it said 'Move a monster of your choice twice' or something and he started asking 'Does the boss-character count as a monster? Does it say boss-character on the card?' etc.  Same game he tried insisting he should be allowed to rest and move because 'rest' was given on the mini-card reminder of possible actions and you are allowed two actions.  When I told him it is included because it is an action but if you take that action it means you can't take any others.  He asked me five times ""Are you saying the card is wrong?"".   

Now, Descent being Descent thankfully there was a wealth of online FAQs and to my relief this was one of them (yes obviously the boss character counts as a monster) and there was a clear explanation of the 'Rest' rule in the rulebook so we could move on but often times there isn't.  In those situations either the game grinds to a halt (indefinitely) or I say 'I don't agree but let's move on' (50/50 chance of success), or we roll a dice for it which is a bummer because I only stand to lose and abandon a rule of the game because it doesn't suit him in this moment in time.  

I'm not sure if he knows that the rules applies and he's doing this because he can get his way or because he genuinely thinks the rule doesn't apply in this case.

Anyway, this generally been a minor annoyance to otherwise fun games nights.  It would be a case of when my wife asked ""How was the games Day?"" I would say something like ""yeah it was smashing, Anonbud got upset again for a while but it didn't last long"".  But recently, we played a game I really love and I left it bummed.  I did well and eventually won and because of that we had to spend most of the game talking about how unfair the game is, how bad Anonbuds luck was, how toxic the game is, how bad the wait times are etc.  I love the post-game break down and this time I just left.  It was a bad feeling. I don't know why this was the tipping point but I just feel I've had enough of it now.   


I love Tabletop games but I I don't want to play them when I'm quietly hoping for another player to win because if he wins, we can all have a good time.  

When Anonbud is winning, we genuinely all have a great time. We had an incredible game of Terra Mystica where he played brilliantly and it was one of the best gaming days we've had in ages.  Everyone was engaged, excited and eager to play again.  That happens too.  And he doesn't always get upset when he is losing.    


So boardgame lovers, what do I do?  Here are my options, as I see them.   


\- Suck it up.  We can all get a bit grumpy every now and then with a bad run of luck too. Maybe he just gets grumpy more often and more vocally than most.  We still often have good fun.  So just keep playing, fingers crossed under the table that he wins or that for some other reason he behaves like a grown up.  


\- Talk to him about it.  I have tried this before. We talked about how cool it is that Otherbud (in games group) is such a lovely fella that even if he finished the game with zero points, he is always in such great spirits and how much fun it is when other players are positive and enthusiastic.  Anonbud even recognised ""yeah I'm not good at that lol"" and so I thought he might catch that behaviour.  He didn't.  

So if I talk to him about it now it has to be more direct.  But like... ""Hey man, could you not act like a giant fucking whiny baby when you lose?  because it is really bumming me out."" Is it possible to say that in anything remotely like a nice way? Is there anyway someone could hear that message and take it as feedback? I don't see any way of doing that which isn't cruel, hurtful and humiliating and I don't want to do that to him.  He's a friend. These are just games.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Stop playing with that group.  This is the saddest one but honestly it's the one I'm thinking of going with.  The other two guys are lovely but it would be a bit gross to 'cut him out' in some way.    


\- Talk to the other two about it?  Nah not really an option.  They are lovely fellas but me and Anonbud are closer to each other than to them. It would feel.. weirdly treacherous and high-schooly to go talking about him with them.  Not for me.  If they have a problem with it they can say it. I'll even back them up.  But I'm not going to rope them into what is really my concern.

85,boardgames,"Hey guys. This game is on 17%-less discount at my local shop and I'm considering picking it up. Few questions:

1. The main question - Is this a good (solo) game?
2. How does 2 characters play instead of 4? I heard it's more difficult, does it scale well?
3. As a follow-up question, is it more difficult due to simply more things to do with less? I don't mind difficulty as long as it doesn't feel unfair.
4. I enjoy some games with luck like Robinson Crusoe, but with other games like Gloom of Kilforth it can feel quite frustrating instead of exciting and fun due to the swingyness. Which category does this fall into?
5. Will the base game provide enough replayability, or should I pick up the Black Goat or Season 2 expansion sometime?
6. I enjoy games like AH:LCG, but I must admit I sometimes find it difficult to get enough motivation to sit and look through the cards, make a deck, setup the scenario and then finally play it. How is this game's setup?

I started in October of 2018 with highly recommended games such as 7 Wonders Duel, Carcassonne, and Fox in the Forest. I think my girlfriend bought Splendor for us as well, but none of these games stuck. Carcassonne sits at a 3/10 for me while Fox in the Forest is a 4. 7WD and Splendor are both decent but I fell off and didn't play any games in 2019. In 2020 I decided to try Spirit Island, my first holy grail. I had been putting it off due to the difficulty but I had nothing to lose so I just went for it.

I still haven't played Spirit Island as much as I would like but I finally hit on some games in the months to follow.

2020 Hits:

Spirit Island (7),
Codenames Duet (7) - most played to this date,
Hanamijoki (10),
Arboretum (7),
The Mind (7),
Baseball Highlights 2045 (9),
Cockroach Poker (8),
Space Hulk: Death Angel (8),
Decrypto (7),
Dinogenics (7),
Watergate (8),
Like 5 Buttonshy games (7s),
Chinatown (8),
The Bloody Inn (7)

In this time I sorta hit on Dominion (I loved this until I got further down my hits list. I find I fall in love with a game and then a previous 10 gets downgraded and shifts my entire system of tiers down a notch lol)

This also happened with Robinson Crusoe and to a lesser extent Nemo's War. Once I found less fiddly solo games (to be mentioned later) I traded these away but they were important stepping stones.

Kingdomino, Lost Cities, Agricola: ACAB, Biblios, Bonanza: The Duel and The Lost Expedition were all fine but I gifted them away as I tried to keep a ""higher standard"" for my enjoyment.

So I probably went through buying around 40 games in the second half of 2020 but 2021 is when I hit on the backbone of my favorites list now.

First, I hit on Cosmic Encounter (10) which is by far my favorite game to play with others. I then got a great deal on everything Aeon's End (9) and played through all the sets way too much.

I also hit on:
Pax Pamir 2e (7),
Deception: Murder in Hong Kong (8),
Shadows in Kyoto (8),
Dungeon Petz (8),
Ra (8),
Wavelength (8),
After the Virus (8),
Flamme Rouge (9),
Obsession (9)

But my two favorite solo have been Darkest Night 2e and Mage Knight. Both 10s. Although, I don't have a victory between the two of them.

I don't have much I want to change, because I waited until I found a good stopping point (for now ☺️), but my next buys will be some combo of Innovation, Agricola, Star Wars: Rebellion, and Targi.

Also waiting on a couple Buttonshy Kickstarters, the new Aeon's End, and Maquis.

I would like to thank the stimulus checks for the funds and not having to work for the time to play, but funnily enough what stopped me for now is my desire to stop having to learn rulebooks. I fear I'm running out of room in my head and I'd like to know all my games decently.

Aside from games the both of us still had from childhood (game of life, monopoly, operation), we started building our collection during Black Friday 4 years ago. We bought Sorry, Trouble, and Clue for $5 each. Since then we have become obsessed with growing our collection. We just bought this Kallax shelf a month ago so our games can be stored in the house instead of the non-temperature controlled garage. So far it holds all of our games, but that includes storing some behind others which then cannot be displayed. My wife keeps saying ""no more games"" because we don't have space to store them, but I can't help myself. I LOVE games. Also our collection grew exponentially the past year because we were helping to support our local game store by purchasing games since they were having a hard time with COVID hurting their business.

126,boardgames,"Earlier this week, I pondered what such-and-such variation of Chess would look like. Perhaps I'll make a separate post about that another day. But to get started, I felt like I had to first answer the question, ""What makes a game 'chess'?"" This of course takes into account all Chatur-based games like International Chess, Shogi, and Xiangqi, and variations thereof.

Here's what I came up with:

1. **Turn-based.**
2. **One player versus one player.** (Sure, Chess variants exist to host more players, and Chess puzzles are single-player, but I'm aiming for a ""main"" variant of Chess.)
3. **Must be a game of** [**perfect information**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information)**.**
4. **The game board must be a rectangle of square spaces. The board should have no holes but can have territories that function differently** (e.g. promotion zones in Intl. Chess &amp; Shogi, the castle and river in Xiangqi, etc).
5. **Both players' objective is to checkmate the opposing King.**
6. **There are only game pieces -- no dice, cards, etc.**
7. **All pieces begin life on the board.** *However*, per Shogi, there may be a ""hand"" for pieces during the mid-game.
8. **The starting layout of one player's pieces is a reflection** ***or*** **rotation of the other player's starting layout.** (Have to say ""rotation"" as well because of Chaturanga and Shogi.)

With a good set of rules, this means anything else can be changed, but this especially includes:

* The pieces, their ability to move, and their ability to capture
* The length and width of the board and any special territories thereof

I'm posting this to r/boardgames first because I suspect you all have played enough non-Chess board games to know if there's anything I've missed, or if these rules also describe something decidedly not-Chess. Thoughts? Have any of you ever played a game that wasn't necessarily based on Chess but follows these rules?",What makes a game Chess-like?
127,boardgames,"Hi everyone! 

After watching a lot of reviews I decided to grab Bargain Quest and the two expansions for it. I've only played it a couple of times and while aesthetically it is nice I feel like its missing some level of strategy/difficultly? 

I have enjoyed that it's fairly easy to learn, but in the games I've played the monsters seem to die very quickly (no more then 1-2 turns), and the heroes are rarely ever lost in combat which makes it feel like there is an element of the game that's missing. This in turn can make it so that buying to many upgrades to your shop puts you at a major disadvantage when it comes to calculating victory points at the end of the game (because you have so few turns to use the advantages that those upgrades give you). 

I've contemplated just giving the monsters more health as a house rule or adding an additional hero to the board to select from but I wanted to see what other people have done to try to improve the game. 

Side notes: I haven't played with the expansions yet, but they seem to add some nice elements.",How to Improve Bargain Quest?
128,boardgames,"Hi,

I got the game in german and maybe some things are translated poorly. So I've got questions about a few cars:

Filius Flitwick, translated from german he says:  
Once per turn:  
If you discard a spell get 1{Flash} and 1 {Heart}.  
Draw a card.

Is the ""draw a card""-section part of the If-condition or can I draw a card no  matter if I discarted a spell before?  
(Just to be safe: allies can't trigger in response to an action from an enemy, since the manual says: you can use them in your turn, right?)  


Same for the golden snitch:  
Draw 2 cards only if you got at least 2 allies or not?  


Confundo (translated from german):  
Your opponent has to discard a random card. If it's a curse or a spell you get 1{Money}.  
Draw a card. If it is an ally you get 1{Flash} and 1{Heart}.

Same as above:   
Option 1) Draw a card only if the discarted card is a curse or a spell  
Option 2) Draw a card anyway  
If option 2 is right: Does the second ""it"" (if it's an ally you get...) refer to the discarted card or to the card you just draw?  


I don't know if it is better in english, I like the game but some wordings are very poor imo.

130,boardgames,"My group recently gathered for a 6 player session, and I was asked to lay out our options in advance. 

While chatting about our options we all sort of agreed that there aren't that many games that can fill that need for a deep, challenging and complex or strategic game. Most of the good stuff stops at the 4 player count.

To give you an idea of what I mean, games falling in this category and scratch the itch for us are:

* Twilight Imperium
* Rising Sun
* Struggle of Empires
* Here I Stand (really hard to get this on the table though)
* Millennium Blades
* Spirit Island (with expansion)

I know there's also Eclipse and Scythe (although Scythe sadly hasn't convinced me as a game) but other than that I really don't know what else falls in this category (maybe the 18xx series? I don't know much about it).

What are your thoughts? Do you think there is space for more? I know its tough to make a heavy game that can accommodate 6 players, but I don't think its chance that -most of- the ones I mentioned above are very highly ranked and loved.",Do you think there are enough heavy 6 player games out there?

132,boardgames,"Hi all! I'm interested in modular board games and have recently been looking. I've seen names like 7th Continent, Gloomhaven, Catan, and other tile-laying games thrown around. I've also seen KS projects like Lost &amp; Found or 7th Citadel come and go, but I'm wondering if there are others.

So what are your favorite modular or tile-laying games and what would you recommend?

For clarity: I've played Gloomhaven JotL and am not really interested in the original Gloomhaven",Modular Board Games
133,boardgames,"**How it started**

Like a lot of people, I grew up playing games with my family. We'd play all the standards, but Cranium was and is our go-to during get-togethers. We get very competitive about it!

&amp;#x200B;

Flashback to Christmas of last year. I was at my girlfriend's family's celebration and they brought out Catan, asking if I wanted to play. I had never played before but of course had heard of it, so I joined them and after the first game I was hooked. I spend the next couple days researching Catan strategies and playing online. We played one more time in person a couple days later before they left. We also played some Codenames, which I hadn't heard of previously.

&amp;#x200B;

This got me thinking...do I love Catan (it certainly is fun with the right group) or do I like the idea of playing board games in general. It wasn't long until I stumbled across BGG and started consuming endless YouTube content - best gateway games, essential games for you collection, etc. The biggest shock to me, and the naivete is hilarious now, was that there were board games CONSTANTLY coming out. I thought the popular ones at Target were about the extent of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**How it's going**

To cut out all of the middle parts that consist of mostly more YouTube and BGG research, I started finding my taste in games. Partially born out of the fact the people in my life aren't necessarily into learning heavier games, but also because I enjoy the solitary experience, I mostly play solo. Jaws of the Lion was the first big game I dove into (Hatchet and Voidwarden!) and since then some of my other faves are Aeon's End and even though I just got it to the table for the first time last night, Cthulhu Death May Die was a lot of fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to catch up on a small backlog I have before I commit time to Mage Knight and Too Many Bones, since those are an undertaking. I got a lot of games at a recent BGG meetup, so I'm making my way through those. I'm mostly caught up on games I want right now, so my purchasing will slow to a crawl while I enjoy these!

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking forward to some in-person group meetups when it's safe to do so - maybe I can finally try out Blood Rage lol!",Started playing this year and can't get enough!

136,boardgames,"A couple months ago I got Anachrony to the table for the first time (at 2 player) and was left feeling very unimpressed. We didn't add in any of the modules and it just felt like a very stale worker placement game. But despite having a poor first experience, I ordered the Infinity box and decided to have another go at it.


We're no stranger to heavy games, so I figured I'd spent my day yesterday reading through all the modules and thought we'd just go ahead and throw everything in. It wasn't until I made it to module 4 of Future Imperfect where I noticed it said ""recommended to not be mixed with Doomsday and Pioneers of New Earth"". So I figured we'd just skip this one and then I got started on Fractures of Time. I've read that this is the best thing released for Anachrony, and once you play with it you'll always want to play with it. I jumped to the compatibility section and also saw that it is not recommended with the same 2 modules from the Classic Expansion. I was a little bummed out, but since I already knew the rules to the previous ones I decided we'd just go with that and I'd learn the 2 skipped ones later.


We played with 3 players and wow. What an incredible game. We ended up playing with B side boards, Doomsday, Pioneers, Guardians, Neutronide Buildings, Hypersync, and Quantum Loop. During our play the 3rd player mentioned that this might be one of their new favorites and ended up winning by 2 points! (Thanks to their Neutronide building). Afterwards everyone agreed that this has to be played again and soon, which got me thinking about module compatibility and what to do for next time. 


I did some googling and only found a few threads going into the modules and the best way to mix them. So that brings me to here:


-How do you rank the modules and why? 


-How do you decide what to play with?


-With Fractures of Time not being compatible with the earlier modules, do you just simply not use those anymore?


Thanks in advanced for any responses! Hoping to see some good discussion on the modules!!",Anachrony

Question though for anyone out there because there is one thing I wasn't sure if we were doing right. 

I kind of figured we were playing it with game 7, so we used all the dark arts cards, Hogwarts cards, and did the requested mix of villain cards. We also played with the Horcruxes (cause.. game 7 right?) and used our game 7 hero cards. Is that how it is meant to be set up? The pack honestly was not clear about that.

149,boardgames,"Hey, I'm new to this reddit page. I started getting into tabletop gaming back in 2016 when I discovered Elder Sign through a YouTube channel called Geek &amp; Sundry. More specifically, it was via a sub-series on that channel called TableTop hosted by Wil Wheaton. It really opened my eyes to this awesome hobby and world of board games that I never knew existed before. I've always been into video games and tabletop gaming was another thing I could nerd over, but in different ways. It's 2021 now and my collection keeps growing. It's not as big as I want it to be yet - my wishlist keeps growing - but I'll get there eventually. The downside is that I don't really have anyone to play with anymore. Back when my hobby started, I always had siblings around to play games with, but a few of them moved away and now I only get to play games with a few friends whenever they aren't busy, which is rare. The last time I got to play anything was over a month ago. This makes it really hard to finish playing through my most recent acquisition - Dice Throne Adventures. It's a game that requires you play through eight scenarios - most of which last 2-3 hours each - to finish it and I just don't have any friends who can visit that often to play it to get anywhere. So I'm hoping that changes soon. My favorite games are definitely Dice Throne and Elder Sign, though I also love Euros and engine builders like Abyss and Res Arcana. I have another game that is being shipped to me in May called Twisted Fables that I backed on Kickstarter, so I'm excited for that.

How can you ever easily see where you can and cannot go? It looks to me like it's totally obfuscated and you need to scrutinize over this at least once per turn.

Is my worry unfounded or can it really be a problem with pathing? I was thinking about how to make it easier to see, and so far I've only thought of the following:

* Take wooden components, for example catan streets. Use 1 color to delimit half connections, and another color to delimit no connections. Putting the component between the tiles as if you would place a Catan street or Takenoko water.

188,boardgames,"I was just asked a question about Clank In Space regarding what happens when there isn't any cubes left in the bag.

The one player got in, grabbed an artifact and headed back out. She died prior to getting into a pod, but would still be counting. The other player was slower and hadn't got the artifact yet, but had built the deck with enough clank removal and healing that they eventually got down to just the 2 red cubes remaining in the bag. Even after this player picked up their artifact it wouldn't push them to the top level, so they wouldn't have 4 red cubes in the bag.

Now I looked in the rules and there doesn't seem to be anything in there regarding this. The rules say the player should pull 6 cubes in a 2 player game. But do they just stop if they pull the 2 red cubes then put them back in? Or is there some other option where they refresh the bag and pull 6 red cubes?

I know Clank Legacy ends the game if you can't pull enough cubes, but there doesn't seem to be any such rule in Space.",Clank In Space - Rule Question

Heavily inspired by the BT organizer, I started with the large tiles and the small parts organizers.  One problem we have is reaching across the table to grab more bamboo and knocking over the ones on the board, so I wanted at least two separate reservoirs for those pieces.  Finally, her main complaint since getting the Chibis expansion was cards spilling all over, so a sliding lid card box solved that issue. That card box sits on top of another empty box that really is just to fill up the space inside the original box.

Hey,

I've had my eyes on Catacombs as my first dexterity game for quite a while. Their Kickstarter launched a few days ago, and will end in 3 days already. Now, since I might as well buy the retail edition for about 60% of the price, could someone elaborate if the game (and the stretch goals) is/are worth it overall, and if the playmats are better than the retail boards? I heard that the edges don't really stick down, and that stickers (?) may leave uneven spots.

Also, is the enormous price gap between the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX"" pledge (130CA$) and the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX PLUS"" pledge (340 CA$) reflected in what you get out of the extra stuff in your opinion?

And on a side note, should I even bother to get Catacombs, or is Crokinole that much better?

215,boardgames,"A few months ago, I really started to get into chess. I really liked the idea of a miniature battlefield with tons of tactics and openings while still keeping it simple. So I decided that it would be fun to make one. In its current state it is playable but I bet there is room for development.

Note: Explaining this on text is hard. The game is actually really simple but all the cordinate stuff may  make it look confusing.

I call it ""Emerald Game"" or just ""Emerald"". It is a two player game played on a square 10 by 10 board which is roughly 900cm²(When writing coordinates, the x axis comes first. Eg: (x,y).). Players can either play as red or blue (Red always starts first). Each player has 7(actually 6) different pieces at their disposal. The objective is to eliminate your opponent's chateau, which is the most valuable piece, in the sense that if they lose it they just lose the game. You can do this by either crushing it or throwing it off the board.

 Yes! You can throw pieces in this. The throwing mechanic is really simple but when you first hear it, you might get confused. So let me explain.

 When a piece that gets on a square that is already occupied by another piece, regardless of color, the original piece that was on the square will get thrown differently depending on which piece threw it. I will explain this better after I introduce the pieces.

Note: I made the board out of a strong cardboard and made every piece by some play dough which I hardened.

\---------The Pieces--------

Note: Pieces can be eliminated by getting thrown off the board or by getting crushed by a chateau.

Note: A player can intentionally walk off their pieces off the board.

(1x)Chateau:

\*When a game starts, the red chateau is placed at (5,5) and the blue chateau is placed at (6,6)

\*When a player's chateau is eliminated, it is game over for them.

\*Can not move by itself.

\*The chateau can spawn any piece that hasn't been eliminated or spawned before in a 5x5 square that it is in the center of. 

\*If thrown, the first piece the chateau bumps into both stops the chateau and directly eliminates the piece it bumped into. (This is an ability that only the chateau has)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Gladiator:

\*Can only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If it gets on a square that is already occupied, it throws the piece occypying it either 2 squares to the left or 2 squares to the right. (Lets say there is a gladiator on (3,3) and it moves to (4,3) where a chateau was standing. Now it throws to chateau to either (4,5) or (4,1))

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Bull:

\*It can see all the way to the north, south, east and west. Can normally only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a bull is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,1) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,1) which are (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,1). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Ram:

(Basically a diagonal bull)

\*It can see all the way to the northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. Can normally only move northeast, southeast, northeast and southwest one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a ram is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,5) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,5) which are (2,2), (3,3) and (4,4). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,8). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wall:

\*Can't do anything.

\*Seriously

\*Doesn't mean its useless tho

\*It can block like rams or bulls or soften a throw(I will tell you about that)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wizard:

\*Can see all the way to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can move only one square to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can pull the first piece it has vision on right next to itself (Lets say a wizard is on (2,2) , there is a wall on (5,5) and a ram on (2,8). The wizard can pull the wall to (3,3) or pull the ram to (2,3).)

\*Pushes pieces only one square.

\*Can be placable for both players only after a chateau regardless of color gets thrown.

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Giant(it is currently not legal, waiting for suggestions)

\*Can see and move to the north, south, west, east, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest only one square

\*Has unlimited throwing power, it will make every piece go flying.

Yeah I made this piece but never used it. It is currently banned because it is too overpowered. The purpose of the giant was to keep the action maximum in every position. It was originally only able to be spawned after a player's every single piece had been eliminated. But I noticed that getting rid of every piece is VERY hard even when you do it intentionally. The piece still exist with some scrapped ideas but I would like to see what other people think it may be good for.

&amp;#x200B;

\-But wait! Yeah pieces can throw each other but what happens if a piece bumps into another piece when it arrives at its destined square?

It just makes the other piece move 1 square the direction it bumped in

\-But what if bumps in to another piece while it is still on the way to its destined square?

It makes the piece it bumped move 1 square and it becomes the new occupier of the square 

&amp;#x200B;

Those principles apply to throwing.

224,boardgames,"So, I’ve been doing YouTube how to play videos, solo playthroughs and things of that nature. 

I’m about to get into doing reviews as well, and I was curious, for anyone reading this what question gets answered for you in a board game review. 

Do you watch reviews for the entertainment aspect?

Maybe you’re watching to learn if a particular game has any mechanics that you might like. 

Or maybe you want to know if the reviewer your watching likes the game and would recommend it. 

I’m sure people watch reviews, how to plays and other board game content for a myriad of reasons, but I’m curious what are you hoping to learn from a review. 

Also, I’m curious as to what sort of format you like to see in reviews. Do you like reviews that are super structured, for example. 

“Today we are reviewing Everdell, and in this review I’m going to break it down for you by theme, art, quality, player interaction, gameplay, etc etc....”

Or do you prefer a more free flowing style where the reviewer literally just jumps from topic to topic in no real formal way, talking to the camera as if trying to sell a friend on how good or bad a game is. 

Also what do you feel about a letter or number score as opposed to “I recommend or do not recommend this game”

And lastly, do you like a more objective review or subjective. Ie, I could say objectively Lost Ruins of Arnak is a great game. The mechanics at play really mesh well together m, bla bla bla. But subjectively, I don’t like it because of A, B, and C. (I actually love Arnak, but just as an example)",Do you watch board game reviews and what question gets answered for you?

229,boardgames,"During the pandemic, my beloved hobby of playing board games with friends (at the table) has been, as I guess for many others in here, pretty much dead. I just re-arranged all my board games in a new shelf and got this idea; what if we could play board games over a conference call / video live with everyone participating from home. I have a lot of friends and colleagues that wants to play, but I’m the one with the games. Meaning we need to play with only one copy of the game. 

I’m really curious if anyone have tried this - in that case what game and how did it go?
If not, then do you have any ideas on what games that could work and how this could be done?

I’m thinking party games in general should be fine, some deduction games and maybe puzzle / mystery solving etc. Hidden roles can be done by showing a card to each player while all others close their eyes / camera. Some coop-games should work fine if all information is public. 

I’m thinking to set up a camera that films the table for everyone to see. Also it could be possible to use regular dice and playing cards as component replacements as I expect everyone to have this at disposal.

One thing that will not work is holding a hidden deck/cards/etc. for players. Open decks could be placed in «player areas» on the table and be shown on camera, so this should work fine.

Note: Please dont recommend apps, PC-games etc. as alternatives. I know and use these, but I want to try this concept with the «real deal»!

Out of my collection I’m thinking these could maybe work:
• Camel Up
• Castles of Burgundy
• Chronicles of Crime
• Codenames (each clue-giver takes a screenshot of the answer card)
• Ghost Stories
• Hey, That’s my Fish
• Magic Maze (this is probably too hard to coordinate)
• Mysterium
• One Night Ultimate Werewolf (maybe without some roles / game master)
• Pandemic
• Ricochet Robots
• Scotland Yard
• Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective
• Small World
• Telestrations
• When I Dream

HONKTOPIA: Illuminati New World Order: Open Source Community Edition: A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

Premier fully functional + meta balanced hyper-compressible meta-memeplex psycho-cultural-alchemic-memetic technology that uses neurolinguistics, hyper-juxtaposition, and  other methods to circumvent synthetic epistemics while programming the players into a 4g/5g warfare psycho-spiritual frame. It exploits memetic virality and asymmetric  psychological-archetypal memetic feedback loops. It takes the form of a trading card game, but it is so, so much more. This is the full 501 card set, and comes with a custom box artwork file (pictured). This is the first of its kind to offer meritocratic access to the zeitgeist. It is a memetic snapshot of 2020. A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

CULTURE WINS WARS. STR33T 4LCH3MY.

Illuminati New World Order set out to expose via card gamification, the World Gamification. The resistance towards and stickiness of the idea means these projects are over the target. The other 4chan and INWO projects always seem to fail, for whatever reason. So I decided to take it upon myself, so there would be no excuse not to complete it. I designed this game as a psycho-cultural-spiritual-memetic weapon-seed-ark. The idea is to train people into an effective perspective, while bringing their memeplex up to date, all abstracted under lulz. I offer this so that you might have content to freely offer someone else and engage with them. The idea is to have the gateway be ""like forbidden lulz??"", and then break the programming implicitly through hyper juxtaposition and archetypal drift. It's content, at minimum. Print them if you want.

This is an open source community project. I want it to run off crypto to combat revisionism and to pay the anons who contribute powerful memes, automatically. This is a method to construct culture meritocratically and transparently, on any scale. Think of the cards as ""culture units"", and their addition to the game as an ""operating body"", upon which the wider ""real"" games that are downstream of culture units are based on. We have reached a phase of development where the 'salt of the earth' makes the best culture(memes), because we are the ones who shoulder shoulder suffering. You'd need military grade training and still often make less viral memes then organic ones (without artificial power-structure support). Essentially, think of this of a movie (culture), of which The People pick the constituent archetypes, scene by scene, in realtime. It's everything a government is sans the bureaucracy, logistics, and corruption. This is a truly unique and interesting cultural artifact.

The information war is a rigged game. We lose by consenting/playing the rigged game, we win by setting the game. Were not in an information war, it's closer to a knowledge war, which may might seem even more daunting, but creativity can be a big player here (vs battling big tech), and if we start playing the knowledge game while they're still playing information game, they won't be able to compete, because their entire empire is based on manipulating information, and if they were to try and train their slaves in knowledge warfare, they would end up setting them free.

The information war was lost before it began, due to asymmetric metaphysical limitations. The information war is a farce. Below that is a mystery/gnostic/luciferian power structure based on the manipulation of knowledge. Both the knowledge game and the information game are asymmetric, but in opposite directions, this is why they want people to think this is an information war because it's the only one they can win.

 Plays like a mixture between yugioh, INWO, and Magic. Most similar to Magic, except ""memes"" have a board locality (""virulence"") mechanic which indicates how far the ""effect"" of the Meme jumps to adjacent connected targets. Infrastructure is like a ""defender"" creature in Magic, except that it also has health. Infrastructure of corresponding resource color is required to play 7+ resource cost Anthropos (creatures), indicated by the golden dragon around their rightmost cost (alternatively you must ""offer/sacrifice"" an Anthropos from the Matrix). Avatars determine your ""Time"" (life points) for the game, the unique win condition, and your special ability for the entire game. This way, 2 decks with the same cards but different Avatars can employ completely different strategies and have different objectives. Memes are essentially spells. Board position is important. Can be quickly and intuitively learned with prior Magic and or Yugioh experience. Built to be intuitive, totally circumventing epistemics and transcending rationality.

Deck = SOUL

Field = MATRIX  
Zone = MATRIX POTENTIAL  
Play = EXECUTE  
Life Points = TIME  
Attack = INFLUENCE  
Defend = RESIST  
Discard = FORGET  
Tap = EXHAUST  
Untap = AWAKEN  
Target = IDENTIFY  
Discard Pile = HISTORY  
Removed From Game = VOID  
Destroy = DELETE

HAND = HAND

This game solves the main problems of INWO:

\-No barrier to entry, free digital (email me, PHYSICAL version for collectors)

\-Open to and requesting input from community, this is for The People  
\-greatly simplified rules, with even more concentrated knowledge  
\-up to date/real time memetic response  
\-Real memes/art/pictures  
\-BOTH backwards and forwards compatible!!! (1800-2100AD+)  
\-I consider this game to be ""revealed"" to me, as the nearly complete plans/rules/concept/theory/implications/instructions just showed up in my head and started to demand to come out. Make of that what you will. Some Terry Davis type jazz. If any Good comes of this, all credit to the Divine.

Card Types:

Anthropos - (""creatures+"")  
Resources - (""Mana""+)  
Memes - (""spells""+)  
Avatars - (""heroes"")  
Infrastructure ? (""defenders""+)

Resource Types:

Blackmail -  
Attention -  
Crypto -  
Metal -  
Cash - \[Worth 3x resources, does not ""untap"" during awaken phase\]  
Market -

Full Set Distribution: (all unique)

Anthropos: \~25 each resource color  
Memes: \~35 each resource color  
Avatars: 14 total.  
Infrastructure: \~10 each resource color  
Resources: \~ 7 of each color

\-Cards are the same size as in Magic the Gathering, 2.5x3.5in

\-All cards are equally rare.

Some have suggested that these may used in the same way tarot is. I'm not a degenerate pagan, but I can say that the card #s were about 90% randomly assigned, completed and digitally released on 12/31/2020-1/1/2021. When I posted this online I got consecutive dubs, dubs, double dubs, immediately locked out of the site with a never before seen false error message, hours later the physical cards were delivered 4!!! days early. I can attest that the synchronistic anomalies with this thing are stubbornly awesome, persistent, too long to list. This tool is a mustard seed, a most peculiar cultural artifact, it is a mechanism to use asymmetric memetic feedback loops to immunize the zeitgeist from synthetic epistemics or ""order out chaos"". It is a sword, a seed, a flower, an ark, and a rock.

**My Background**  
At home when I (34M) we mainly played 2 types of boardgames: roll and move (monoply, the goose game, ...) and knowledge based games (trivial pursuit, some dutch dictionanry game, ...). While I liked playing with my family board gaming was not my main favourite activity.  
Later in my life Catan came out and I was triggered a bit more, because (for me at the time) this game had theme. But when I played it the first time, I was about 11 years old, very unaware that board gaming was considered a hobby. So during the years I played mainly with my family the same games.  
Until about 4-5 years ago I bought “Legends of Andor”, this was the real eye opener for me a game that, after all the others, had so much theme in it. I played through all the scenarios in 3 days or so. After that I weant on searching for something that was less of a puzzle and more lets-kill-some-monsters type of game. For that I found Castle Ravenloft, but the real change was during this research finding out about BGG and a lot of Youtube channels about boardgames. All of which led me to the rabbit hole that is the hobby.  
My latest revelation in this is Facebook groups for secondhand games, which does not save me a lot of money but does increase the amount of games I can get for the same amount of cash.

**Player profile**  
My main playing partner is my wife. I like complex games with lots of theme in them and my wife likes more thinkier games with streamlined rulesets.

**Favorite games in collection**

Would appreciate opinions from more experienced players on which it is likely to be.  

I tend to attack a lot and focus on trying to remove her counters, while she is a little more proactive with trying to take tiles. Last night we had a slog-fest (scenario 3) where I felt like I was super far ahead the whole time but after an hour and a half kinda blundered and we ended up both pinned with equal objective points, but she had momentum so won. I was pissed because I was left scratching my head as to how I ended up losing and I'm not sure she felt it was a particularly satisfying win.  

Today we played scenario 4 and I was the US (so started with snipers) so I was again quite attack heavy, what with that being the snipers main strength. This time I did manage to grind her out and this time she was super pissed, while the snipers felt kinda OP to me and it felt like quite a one-sided fight.  

She reckons I'm not quite playing in the spirit of the game, because I tend to not really proactively go after tiles, instead trying to dwindle her army down to control the board. But that has often felt like the best strategy to me, and I know war games are quite attritional. Maybe we are just both not quite understanding the appeals of the genre (this being our first war game of any description), maybe the direct conflict is just too confrontational.  

However, I do have a few issues with the game itself. There seems to be an overall advantage for the US, and I've seen some data that supports this on a BGG forum (even if the advantage is slight, there is a statistically significant advantage for one player in several scenarios). Some of the scenarios (especially 3) feel wayyyy too long - again, maybe this is an issue with my playstyle, although neither of us have even utilised the Scout's 'Conceal' action, which I imagine would only prolong the game and make it more grindy. A 90-minute playtime for one scenario is too much for what feels like a pretty die-dependent game. Now, I appreciate you often make your own luck in games, and for the most part the combat system works more or less as intended. But out of our 4 scenarios we've had one game that was genuinely decided from 2 lucky consecutive rolls early on, and 1 other scenario where die luck sung wildly in a way that ended up making the subsequent gameplay feel a little unsatisfying for both of us. I just can't shake the feeling the games take way too long for a game that is essentially given determined by die rolls.  

So what is leaving the sour taste - is it our fault, either for playing the game ""wrong"" (not in the spirit intended), or for not embracing the confrontational nature and die-dependency of the game? Or are there genuine issues with the game itself?",Undaunted: Normandy - Are We Doing it Wrong?

287,boardgames,"I recently got a chance to play Quetzal on Board Game Arena. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience with the game, though it fell short in a few places.

**Mechanics**

Quetzal is a unique work placement / bidding game that has players ""rolling"" double-sided meeples to determine their starting resources each round. On one side, you'll have archeologists, the other adventures. Both types have specific spots on the board they can go to, as well as, a couple of shared spaces where either archeologists or adventures will do the trick.

I found this mechanic to be much more than a gimmick, as the types of meeples that you and your fellow players roll will help determine not only where, but also when you should place your meeples. While some places on the board can be activated by a single Meeple, other places will require you to have majority, which can be lost if another player can place a higher number of meeples. I found this mix of bidding and worker placement very enjoyable. 

Another nice piece of tension was its scoring system. Some places will allow you to collect cards on the board that can later be turned in for set collection scoring. However, it costs meeples and currency to  to score your cards, so you want to do balance these to actions.  

**Theme**

This was the game's biggest disappointment for me. The Indiana Jones / Aztec theme felt a little weak.  Also, while there was almost no flavor text to setup the game's story, it was clear that we were simply stealing ancient artifacts from the island and packing them onto boats to sell. I think there was a missed opportunity to have a more exciting, colorful, and fun theme for this game.

**Graphic Design**

The game board's jungle green, mixed with wood brown and paper tans did little to make it pop. After everyone places their meeples, worker placement spaces must be resolved in a specific order. I was expecting the order of resolve would be from left / right, top / bottom, but the sequence turned out to be a little bit of a tricky maze. I'm not sure why they laid it out that way.

296,boardgames,"**tl;dr**: What's the most interesting 'space' for interacting/moving/etc. in a game that you've encountered?

I'm an academic cartographer/GIScientist (gosh, I hate that term) and due to some 'lucky' coincidences, like the pandemic making field work impossible, I have a bit of funding to study spatial models in games. 

While my colleague on the project and myself have a fairly well developed set of materials to focus upon, we've obviously not played  every board game out there. I thought it might be fun to ask /r/boardgames what their favorite game 'spaces' might be and look into picking up games that I might not have. 

While just your favorite map is totally appreciated, I'm more asking about how space is modeled for interaction in the games. For example, the way that **Guns of Gettysburg** uses detailed study of the terrain to create a pseudo-time-travel based board or how **High Frontier** attempts to model energy requirements for travel...

In truth, if you just have a favorite **board** game, I'd love to hear about it in as much detail as you'd like to share. If you're super interested in the larger research project, feel free to DM me.",Your favorite spatial model (or just map) in a game?

298,boardgames,"I'm a little lost with the strategy behind this game and I was hoping someone could help me out a bit. I've played LoW twice now, and both times I've been absolutely crunched (4th out of 4 people yesterday, with the 3rd place person 30 points ahead of me). I've played worker placement games plenty, especially Agricola, and I'm usually right near the top but for some reason I can't get a handle on LoW.

For some extra context: yesterday we played with the Skulldeep expansion and I played as the lord who wants Warfare and Piety quests. There were none in my opening hand, so I worked on the quest that gave me extra black cubes for going to the inn. Once a Warfare quest popped up I grabbed it, and kinda followed a pattern of collecting cubes for the quests in hand until someone reset the quest board and flipped more relevant quest types. Where I started to get lost was when other players were completing quests worth 20-25 points the turn after finding them, since my little 8-12 point quests took me at least that long to complete. This was the pattern for the rest of the game, with the others seeming to get twice as many points as me for the same number of meeple placements.

After the game I asked for advice, and all I got was ""You just need to gather more cubes"", but there wasn't anywhere to do that! There weren't any decent buildings and I took advantage of the Skullport spaces when the resources they could give me were relevant to my quests. One of the other players told me I must have gotten unlucky, but blaming my results on luck feels like a cop out. It feels like there's something I'm missing as far as the strategy here.

My wife isn't huge on brain burner games, but wanted to get other people's opinion on how accurate the complexity rating is for this game.

305,boardgames,"So, my girlfriend _loves_ all things fantasy. She seems to read through some new seven-book fantasy series every week, and our bookshelves are overflowing with them. And yet, when it comes to boardgames, all she wants to do is trade in the Mediterranean. Which is fine, we have a lot of mid-weight Euros that we both like. But I'd also love to find something that appeals on a more thematic level. I think a big part of the reason she hates most fantasy games is that she despises combat as a mechanism, which means dungeon crawlers and big epic war games are out of the question. Doesn't matter whether the combat is player vs. player or players vs. game either, by the way. She does like stuff like Everdell and Belfort, which are sort of fantasy-themed but more focused on building things. I think she'd also appreciate something about magic but in a non-combat setting - I've had my eye on Res Arcana but I don't know of any others.

309,boardgames,"So I love the Witcher IP. I love the sword combat, I love the characters, the lore. Literally everything. That being said, I’m having a hard time nailing down The Old World and wether it is going to be good or not. 

I think it’s to early to tell, but I’d love to hear some opinion on the latest video if you’ve seen it. 

In this video they talk about combat between monsters and other Witcher’s. I wasn’t sure how I’d like combat, I do prefer dice just because there is that luck factor, but I did enjoy the card mechanics in something like Journeys Through Middle Earth. 

Although dice is what I prefer, I think I can get behind the deck building mechanics and combat mechanics in this one, because it really allows you to set up those really nice combos for a powerful attack. I also enjoy that it’s the other players that get a chance to control the monsters when you are fighting as a Witcher. I really think that’s a good call otherwise there’s a potential to have some really bored players at the table. 

I was initially worried about the Witcher bs Witcher combat though because I figured if you were playing 4 players, it would suck to be the other 2 players just waiting around, but it seems that combat could be rather quick with some experienced players. On top of that, just from the brief mention of it in the video, it seems they put in a betting system, so you can bet on who you think will win the fight, which will have players a little more invested in what’s going on at the table instead of sitting there on their phones while they wait for their turn. 

Anyway, that’s pretty much all I have to say about this weeks video. I’m really looking forward to see the main board, and how the actual exploration will look.

  From my mama/papa cards, I started with two Vine cards, and a windmill.  By game end, I had planted 7 vine cards (a lot of small-value Malvasia 1white or the 1r/1w vines). That yielded 7/20 VPs right there. 10 points from two wine orders and the other three were visitior cards

327,boardgames,"Hey Everyone,

Basically the title. My girlfriend loves horses, and we love board games, and I would really love to surprise her with some sort of horse-themed board game for her next birthday.

Dungeon Petz is one of our favorites, but I don't imagine there is a stable-managing board game on the market like it, I just wanted to illustrate the limit of complexity. We love worker placement games in general, so something where you raise/gather/tame horses and do something like in DP with them to gain points would be truly amazing - but set collection games, or building games (like 7 Wonders or Kingdomino, respectively) would be amazing too. 

Maybe a Cat Lady or a Dog's Life reskin with horses?

I'm not sure how well horse racing games would be received, I suspect the managing/caring aspect would be a bigger success, but I would love to check any horse-themed games at all.

Also, as the title says, it would be nice if I could actually get it somewhere :)

Some additional games we regularly play end enjoy: Everdell, Yamatai, Scythe, Pandemic, Raiders of the North Sea, Architects of the W.K., Carcassonne, Azul, Terraforming Mars, Five Tribes, PatchWork, Isle of Cats

I'm happy with where my collection is at. I trade a lot, once a year I'll go through our games and if something wasn't played in the last year I'll trade it away for something new. This has kept the collection small and full of games that regularly get played.

All time favorites: Clans of Mystica Project, Village, Caylus, Keyflower, Underwater Cities and Brass.

Recent editions I have really been enjoying: Pavlov's House, Under Falling Skies, Celles and Undaunted: North Africa.

Unpopular opinions (games I didn't like): Great Western Trail, Lowlands, and Blood Rage

329,boardgames,"Hey All, About a year and a half ago I posted [this bar chart race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-DTg_-EKRk&amp;t=5s&amp;ab_channel=EranHirsch) of logged plays at BGG throughout the years. I was actually collecting the data for what i'm posting about today, but bar-chart-races were all the rave. My real project though was to find out what games are good at what player counts.

The idea was simple, BGGs own community-based recommended player count is an opt-in poll. Even very popular games have a disproportionately low participation in this poll, making it extremely biased and somewhat misleading. There had to be a different way! BGG also has logged plays, and these logged plays also have number of players, this was what I was looking for. BGG doesn't provide an API to easily fetch exactly this information, so I [built this project to scrape logged plays efficiently](https://github.com/eranhirsch/bgg_players_count).

But looking at a single game didn't give me enough information. If a game is played at 2-player 30% of the time is that good or bad? The next step was to scrape *everything!* I expanded my code, and let it run for about a week feeding it game IDs I scraped from (a) top 2K ranked games, and (b) top 2K games ordered by number of rankers. I then filtered out games that didn't have enough data points (1000 ""meaningful"" logged plays, meaningful being that they also have the players segment filled).

**The end result is this file:** [**BGG Player Counts \[Google Sheets\]**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vp8e4FpILk6dBTbJRiR4DCAvBRCOMYGrZQ1xwEUtdVk/edit?usp=sharing)**.**

To make analysis easier I used conditional coloring to create a visual cue of how good or bad is this ratio in for this player count; why? The assumption is that each player count is more or less likely to be played without regard to the specific game: If a game is good at 2 and 3 players, it would most likely be played more by 2 players (because smaller groups are more likely to get together and play), but how good it is in that player count is a factor of how similar games are played. In other words, if almost no game is has plays at 10% for 6 players, those 10% mean much more than a game that is played 10% for 2 players.

This all sounds confusing but it actually looks like it works. We can see that games renowned for being 2-player optimized like Race For the Galaxy, Castles of Burgundy or Santorini have a high 2-player ratio, but other games like Scythe or Terra Mystica have low 2-player ratios. It's even interesting to see that Codenames and Decrypto have almost identical biases towards *even* player counts stemming from the fact that they split groups into 2.

So how do you use this file?

* Pick the player counts you are interested in from the tabs at the bottom, i've recalculated the data separately for each play count as it slightly changes the ""ideal""ness.
* If you are interested in games that are suitable for more than one play count (let's say 2 player and 4 player) use the range tabs (2-4 in this example)
* Find the game you are looking for and check out the colors.
   * If the play count you are interested in is Green, that's great!
   * If the play count you are interested in is Red you might be better off checking out a different game!
   * Notice that if the colors are faded or almost white it's not a bad thing! it means that this game is pretty good at all player counts! 
* Just for fun I cut the data separately for some other interesting cases at the end, Top Ranked, Top Played, Games from 2020, and Board Game Arena games.

**Notes:**

* I ""normalized"" the data based on BGG ""published"" player counts, and kept it simple so that games that have extra player support via expansions won't be represented here, You can see for example that Catan is billed as a 3-4 player game. It was too complicated to take those factors into account.
* Looking at the data critically we can also see that some games try to match a larger set of player counts than they should missing on all counts - These games would just show up red where they could have been greener (Like The Crew's 2 player variant). On the other hand, some games are so good at defining the player count that all play counts are Green, like Puerto Rico!
* Use this data as a tool, not a system - Some games might be ideal at a different player count but fun for your group regardless (I play a ton of Innovation at 3p), and some games might seem perfect but are just not fun. This is not a recommendation system, it should be used as a way to steer from making clearly bad decisions.",Would this game be fun at player count x?

I'd like to transfer a few dozen games into long term storage, but don't want to put them into cardboard boxes or leave them exposed in their own.  Since the storage space won't be climate controlled (garage or basement), I'll have to try and weatherproof the box if it isn't already (some bins have a foam seal) and throw in some desiccant.  I'd think that a great size would a multiple of the standard game box size (12"" x 12"" x \~4"").  So a 12"" x 12"" x 24"" box, for example, would fit 4-6 at a time and not be overly heavy or hard to move.

The reason I'm asking here is that looking around is proving pretty tedious without just getting a giant tub.

Firearm combat/customization.  
- Board games seem to steer clear of firearm combat. Maybe because of lethality or desire for more fantastical elements. I am looking for a game with good gun combat. Preferably pvp. I am also interested in customization. It seems like something a board game could utilize really well with stat boosts/losses based on certain attachments.

Asmodee's purchase of Fantasy Flight Games in 2014 in retrospect feels like the beginning of the problems for the company, and the departure in recent years of Christian Peterson and other long-time employees, as well as the reported layoffs are very troubling.

FFG has long had a history of publishing fantastic games, and providing support and backing to them for quite some time, regardless of whether the game was widely acclaimed, Runebound being a good example here. Lately however FFG seems to be primarily focused on their licensed products such as Star Wars, Marvel, and Arkham Horror. 

For a company that produced and supported so many fantastic and unique board games, and that championed the LCG concept, it is sad to see them moving to a more corporate position.

While it feels like most of the blame could be focused on Asmodee, we'd love to hear your thoughts on FFG, and where things may have started to change for them. Or if you even think they've declined at all! FFG still produce some fantastic games, and while they may have moved away from some of their more unique games, they still put out good products and continue to support several of their larger products.

Naturally, now that Kickstarter is offering the Everything-Ever-Made-for-Everdell-in-the-History-of Ever Complete Collection, I'm eyeing that and wondering if I should take the plunge. That said, I tend to like the idea of expansions much more than the actual expansions. I far prefer the ""more content""  expansions to those that add extra rules and complexity, which seems to be the case with most expansions (especially when I look at the Everdell ones with the additional boards). Everdell seems like a fine game that I could play for a long time, but the FOMO hits hard.

364,boardgames,"&amp;#x200B;

Howdy! My name is Mackenzie Franklin, owner of **SideGameLLC** in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I own a personal game night service here in the Springs where we bring games from a large library to teach and play!

One big thing that I prioritize is getting games started quickly, and that all comes down to the organization of the box itself. I have a lot of videos on my Youtube Channel dedicated to this very thing!

I thought I'd share my 3 biggest tips when I organize games:

1. **Plastic Bags are the worst.** 

The amount of time it takes to open a bag and dump the contents into something stacks up so incredible fast. It's annoying and time consuming to take out, and it's annoying and time consuming to put away. Containers of any form that also serve as a bowl or plano-style organizers are your best friends. The best of these come from the Dollar Tree (or any local dollar store), where you can get lots of small containers, ""art supply organizers"" or ""tool organizers"" that will fit various components. There's nothing better than opening a single lid and having 12 individual components already sorted and ready to go. Plastic bags can still be used obviously if needed, but when you can, get rid of them!

1. **Reduce the amount of boxes.**

What's more time consuming than rifling through multiple boxes? If you can fit everything into a single box logically and without destroying anything, do it. I will gladly take an inch of lid lift if it means I can open a single organized box. Sometimes it can't be helped having things in multiple boxes, but when you do make sure it's logical how you're storing things in those boxes. All expansion content in one box, all characters decks, all the miniatures, etc. Don't be afraid to get a larger box for a smaller game if it just isn't working. It's about getting the game played.

1. **Inserts and Storage that come in the box are not always the best.**

Goodness gracious there are some terrible inserts that come in games. Granted, a lot of them are just there to keep things safe during shipping, but if they don't have spots for sleeved cards or have you taking a bunch of extra time taking little pieces out of deep wells, I'll pass. Throw away these inserts and don't look back. Sometimes having 4 plastic bags (I know right?) with all the player components in them is all you need. Don't bother with printing or buying inserts that complicate things in order to look pretty. Also, sometimes modifying the existing insert can be your best bet! Don't be afraid to cut an insert to keep the useful parts while throwing away the rest!

I hope some of you find this useful!

I love the premise of this game, but it has only been released (so far) as a print &amp; play version. I love the artwork, and would like to have a high-quality printing of the cards and books.

My printer does a fine job, and I've got several PnP games under my belt, but it is slightly off when printing front and back and can only handle low quality card stock. I would prefer to have high quality cards printed, get the rulebook in a manual format, and have the story book spiral bound.

Before I start calling FedEx to see if they have any good printing options, do any of you know of good resources online for something like this? I know it would likely cost a bit to get a one-off printing, but this game seems worth spending the effort and money on. I left a comment on the video to see if Jesse could tell me where he got his done, but I haven't gotten a response yet and I'm impatient, lol.

Thanks in advance!

Other deck builder games, like Star Realms, instead there is a big deck of cards and the supply is just drawn of the top of this deck.  Every card is in the deck for every game.

Has anyone tried using the Star Realms style mechanic into a game like Dominion?  Does it work?  Does it break anything?  This would make games less predictable, but also save a lot of time on setting up each game, as you just pull out one stack and shuffle it; good for every game.

Specifically, I am thinking of applying this to the game Puzzle Strike; where I just mix all the cards (5 of each unique type) into one deck (technically all the chips in one bag), and use a supply of 10 random different ones (duplicates in the bank would not count toward the 10).

\-My wife couldn't care less about Dune but LOVES this game (Lords of Waterdeep and Lewis &amp; Clark are among her favorite games)

**What doesn't work?**

\-Why oh why is there no inherent way to flush the face up cards in the market?

\-Worker placement spaces on the board lose some of their luster after several plays, becoming just a way to obtain/exchange the games many resources

\-I didn't really mention this in the review but the board focusses too much on the cold blackness of space and makes look barren like mars; this contrasts to how I envision it as a fan. Arrakis should be arid but brilliant, dangerous but beautiful. Some of the cards nail it, the board just kinda looks blah. 

**Overall**

Really like it. I've played it 8 times at this point and just want to play more. It's not particularly innovative in any one department but super cohesive with it's disparate elements which makes it really compelling.

If you buy him, does that automatically give you a second pick that turn?

Example two cards out : govorner and a 4 coin ship. Can you buy the govorner for 8 then take the 4 coin ship as your second pick? 

My thoughts were that special cards like the govornor would only trigger if you already have them at the start of your turn.

404,boardgames,"I think that most board game hobbyists have been aware of price creep. But I am curious in regard to board game prices relative to inflation. Yes, there are games being sold today at prices that seem high (historically speaking), but are those prices actually just keeping pace with inflation, or outpacing inflation?

Is there a way to find out how much **Clue,  Monopoly**  and ** Risk**  were selling for in 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020 so that I can see if mass market games are keeping pace with inflation, outpacing inflation, or falling behind? 

I am more curious on how hobbyist/designer games fare in relation to inflation. However, there are not many of those that have been selling continuously from 1980 to the present. **Diplomacy**  and **Cosmic Encounter**  are two that I can think of. **Modern Art** has been around since 1992, so one could get a decent picture of how it has fared in relation to inflation as well. I am not sure what other hobbyist/games would be good candidates to reveal the long-term impact of inflation on the hobby.

I have been building my solo game empire more recently due to this pandemic thing (hasn't everyone?) and it's been very rewarding. So many interesting solo games out there to play! From the insanely complex GMT stuff to the adventures and dice rolling heartbreak of Ignacy games to the weird and wonderful kickstarter stuff like Gate and Dark Venture. I love the artwork and components - and organizing them - this gets me really excited about the hobby. It allows everyone to have their own spin - and upgrading these components is a hobby in and of itself. I love fiddling with bits and chucking dice - I just love this goddamn hobby so much. Can't wait to be able to play with my friends again soon.

If I could go back 20 years, I would have told myself to start sooner...and to be a little choosier with purchases. I think I have a lot of unique games, but a ton of overlap...and some titles that just don't really excite me anymore (I'm looking at you Machi Koro).

409,boardgames,"The base game of It's a Wonderful World is superb. Exactly what I want out of 7 Wonders, but shorter and leaner, easier to teach. The only downside for me is that card drafting games are best utilized with a large group, and base IaWW caps at 5p. Luckily the expansion goes up to 7. I'd like to get the KS edition from my flgs before they're all gobbled up, but I don't know if we'll have 7 players until our usual groups are all vaccinated. That may be many months from now. The game is good at lower counts too, but if all the expansion does is add complexity, I have other engine builders for that.  

* Is the expansion worthwhile for solo/2p for now?  
* Is it worth it to rush to get the KS edition, or is the best stuff in the regular expansion?

I did a quick search and didn't find too much recent discussion of historical war games a la GMT 's specialty (e.g. Churchill, Labyrinth, Fire in the Lake, Sekigahara, etc.). I know that a comparative hit recently was Imperial Struggle, but other than that, I'm largely out of the loop on the genre and its 'big hitters.' 

Regardless, Twilight Struggle has been one of my favorite games for a while now and I've considered branching out further into this design space. Although I could probably theorize about why I enjoy TS for a few paragraphs, I think at least a portion of my enjoyment comes from the fact the game provides the occasion to reflect on the dynamics of the actual historical events and processes.  (Don't worry, I'm not suggesting that TS is or ought to be considered 'educational').

A few people in that discussion made an interesting argument that I’m not sure I agree with though, and I’m curious to hear others thoughts - they argued that the cost of a game could also reflect the quality of the design.

I think I disagree, because if publishers were to mark up based on some metric of how great the design is, we might have some really.... weird pricing on certain games (thinking especially in the small box, fantastic designs like **Innovation**, **RftG**, **Battleline**, etc).

422,boardgames,"This has been on my mind recently and I'd love to hear some thoughts from the rest of the community. How do you think the overlap between board games and video games will evolve in the future?

We're already seeing:

* More board games getting video game conversions
* Board games getting more placement at gaming events like PAX East and PAX West
* Video games being adapted to board games (the Divinity game comes to mind for one)
* More board games experimenting with AR or companion apps and other tech

And [this story](https://www.geeknative.com/129467/long-running-mud-rolls-out-quests-written-by-tabletop-designers/) really sparked it for me: A text-based MMO (or a MUD, if you're old like me; and who knew those were still a thing) hired a bunch of tabletop designers and personalities to make what is basically DLC for their game. So that's an example of boardgame and tabletop design becoming a desirable skillset in the video game space. Yes, there is a ton of similarity between those fields of design, but I also think there are some unique elements there that maybe a typical video game designer might not be strong in.

With boardgames and tabletop growing, and with video games overlapping more and more, where will this go next? Are there parts of this potential that haven't been explored yet?

I'm a long time lurker of this sub (and the wider board game scene - BGG etc), but a first-time poster. I started to really investigate the world board games about three years ago and since then I've probably amassed about 15 or so games for my personal collection (mostly including the usual gateway games (ticket to ride, mysterium, pandemic etc). But one game that I absolutely love is Scythe, and during the past year of lockdowns, it has kept me and my SO sane during the countless hours indoors. 

When researching if I wanted to purchase the Rise of Fenris expansion (I did, it's amazing!), I came across painted minis on Google and knew I had to have them. Buying them was too much of an expense, so I started researching mini painting and thought I'd give it a go. I'm definitely not the creative type, and have never painted anything more than my living room wall, but, as like a lot of folks I'm sure, I found that I had a lot of time on my hands this year so thought it would be a new hobby at least. 

I just wanted to share my results here, because even though they are probably a 2/10 to the trained eye, I'm super proud of myself for putting in the hours (and a lot of them!) and following through. Once I had finished the minis, I had the bug, so I then went on Etsy to buy the 3D buildings and painted them too. Please be kind...

About 9 months ago I self-published my first ever RPG. It bears the name of ""A one in a million chance at adventure"". I made it as a work of fanfiction/as a tribute rule system. The system itself is based primarily around a 2D10 / partial success mechanic, and a FATE inspired skill system, where players develop their character throughout the game. It is made specifically for shorter campaigns, and with a heavy focus on a fairly narrative game experience driven by an actor stance.

Could I play the same campaign alternating different groups? Reason being sometime I'd like to play with my girlfriend but more often it would be just me and a couple of friends


How does the sense of progression actually feel? I know the story is so so but I'm more interested in seeing character growth and how the actual city / map changes affect the game.

499,boardgames,"I'm looking to entice an 8 year old into strategy board games and wanted to get some opinions out there on 2 fronts:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Suggests on an introductory, strategy board game for 2+ players for ages 8+. I did a quick search and came across a list that had some [promising options](https://www.boardgameswizard.com/kids/8-year-olds/). A couple of games that caught my eye were Kingdomino and Magic Maze. However, when I looked at Kingdomino, I saw they had a Kingdomino Duel version. I'm pretty sure most of our gameplay will be me and the 8 year old, but we do have more people that could possibly play with us. I just want to make sure that a game that's advertised as 2-4 players is still really enjoyable with only 2 players. For instance, I've played 2-player 7 Wonders (which is clearly meant for 3+ players) for awhile before getting 7 Wonders Duel for a real 2-player experience. I don't want that same experience when picking out a game for an 8 year old. 

2) When reviewing the pictures of Kingdomino, I saw that the pawns are standard looking pawns. I'm wanting to buy a separate set of pawns or figurines that look more realistic. Think D&amp;D style. Again, the idea is to entice the 8 year old to engage with the board game with cool pieces that they can use their imagination with. So I'm looking for suggestions of where I can buy detailed figurines that may be used in future gameplay of other board games. Specifically a variety of classes (i.e. Warrior, Thief, Priest, mage, Paladin, etc) instead of race (Humans, orcs, elves, dwarves, etc.) though I'm not opposed to having a variety of races if I can't find classes.

Any ideas and thoughts to make the board game experience ""come alive"" would be great! 

Thank you!",Request: Strategy game for an 8 year old

502,boardgames,"So from a visual perspective, which game in your collection is the ugliest/has the worst art and which one has the best!

For ugly, this was kind of difficult for me because I usually get drawn to pretty games in the first place, but! Initially, I was gonna go for Codenames, but that game is really more minimalist when it comes to its art, and it works well. So I ended up going with Dune (2019). The box itself is gorgeous, but the character portraits are all kind of bad, and the tokens are all just bland little cardboard circles. I wouldn't say the game is ugly, per se? All the colors work well together. But, it is a little bland looking, I feel! I still love the game.

For prettiest, this was also hard because there's so many good looking games! My prettiest game is probably PARKS though. All the illustrations are gorgeous, it's got a bunch of really nice wooden tokens, the first player token is made of metal, and the board's wood look goes really well with everything. Also the hiker meeples' colors are just really pleasant? Oh also, the whole game fits really compactly into this cute little box, and it even has a guide on how to store it! So, overall, it is quite the looker!

Honorable mentions to Root and Wingspan. I would also say Pax Pamir 2e, but I do not own that yet.

503,boardgames,"I was just looking through my collection, and I realized that most of the recent games I've gotten have just been good or fine. The last year I got that truly and honestly wowed me was **Spirit Island,** which is now 4 years old. A couple other that year were close as well, **Gaia Project** and **Twilight Imperium 4**, were amazing as well, but after 2017, it really seemed to nose dive for me.

Don't get me wrong, there's been several games I had fun with, but the only other sort of recent game I got that I really clamored to play again was **Teotihuacan** (2018).  While I don't want to just hate on Kickstarter since I think some quality has genuinely come from it, it seems like the only thing mattering now is component quality, often taking the lead to solid game play. 2011-2016 really seemed to be the sweet spot for amazing games for me. **Through the Ages 2nd (2015), Scythe (2016), Feast for Odin (2016), Terraforming Mars (2016), Eclipse (2011), Castles of Burgundy (2011), Concordia (2013), 7 Wonders Duel (2015), Orleans (2014)** all wowed me in ways I didn't think were possible.   


More recent titles have all kinda just left with a ""that was fun enough"" reaction rather than a ""Let's play again!"" reaction, or even just a ""I'd rather play x designer's older games"" It's not for lack of trying. Some of the more recent lauded games I've played are  **Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion (2020), The West Kingdom Trilogy ('18, '19 '20),  Maracaibo (2019), Underwater Cities (2018), Hallertau (2020), Tekhenu (2020) Sleeping Gods (2021), Cryptid (2018), Wingspan (2019), Root (2018), 7th Continent (2017).** It's not that I don't think these games are good, they are, but they just seem to lack a bit of a wow factor for me, and out of all those games, I'd rather play something on my first list.

&amp;#x200B;

Even looking at the BGG top 50 or so there's only a couple games that have been released post 2017. I know it takes awhile for people to play and rate them, but it seems like there's a bit of a fall off happening. 

I know I won't like every game I play, but it seems like there's less that's even appealing to me, and it's getting more expensive to give a game a shot. $60 used to get me a huge game, and often $40-50 would be enough.",Is the Board Game Renaissance Over? Or am I just growing out of the hobby?

520,boardgames,"In Struggle of Empires 2-7 Players take the role of one of the major powers of the 18th century and fight in both Europe and the colonies over the course of three rounds (or wars). In each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other for the duration of that war.

At the end of each war, area control will be assessed in 11 territories and victory points will be awarded accordingly. Control is established by control markers which are mostly a fixed resource each game. Depending on the player count there will be a certain number of neutral markers placed on the board at the beginning of each war. Other than that, after the initial placement of player control markers at the beginning of the first war, control markers can only be gained by attacking other players’ control markers. If you win, their marker is removed and replaced by one of yours.

There are a lot of choices that the game’s mechanics require you to make. First and foremost, since you cannot directly attack an ally, the auction mechanic dictates a lot of what you’ll be able to do during that particular war. Allies can (but are not required to) lend support to combat strength for allies during battles. Negotiation is encouraged and can lead to some interesting moments. The alliances also can affect your expansion decisions as well due to the location of each nation’s control markers and troops on the map. A hotly contested victory point region from one war might be completely silent in the next due to shifting alliances.

Gold and economy are super important and it always seems like there isn’t enough. If ever you do not have enough money for something you want to do, you must tax your population. For every 2 gold that you need, you most draw an unrest token, which is bad. Unrest tokens range from 0-2 with the vast majority of tokens being ones.

If a player has 20 or more unrest at the end of the game, that player is eliminated. Players with less than 20 will lose victory points if they have the most or second most unrest at the end of the game. And since money and actions are so intertwined, unrest hangs over every decision you make.

There is luck involved and the dice can definitely crush you. But the dice rolling mechanic encourages you to build up your strength BEFORE rolling to increase your odds, because the dice can never increase your strength by more than 5 points.

Struggle of Empires is not for the light-hearted gamer. But if you have a group that likes some intelligent fisticuffs, and can remain friendly after 4-5 hours of thoughtful strategy and quick, deadly combat, I bet you should have a lot of fun.

1: I watched the SUSD review and think the game sounds excellent. Is there anything negative not covered in that review I should consider?

I am considering buying a french copy of the game as this is the most readily available - assuming I can get the rules online, is there much in game reading e.g. turn specific action cards which would need to be translated to be able to make decisions?

541,boardgames,"Now that they're run by Asmodee, it appears that FFG now have a return policy that mimics Asmodee's, sadly. I traded for a full set (base game and all expansions) of Eldritch Horror, but it's missing a few cards. Yes, I could return it and cancel the trade, but before I resort to that, I wanted to at least try to get replacement cards first. The problem is, their policy now is to put the responsibility on the *store that sold the game*. In this case, it was a trade, and even the person I got it from likely was not the original purchaser. Am I out of luck then? 

I've checked the BGG stats for ""Has Parts"" and no one seems to have these 4 particular cards (Outer World encounters, btw). BGG really needs to police that feature, as 90% of the ""has parts"" are not used to showcase extra parts they have available. 

I have no idea how to get these cards other than printing proxies, which is a far inferior solution. How do stores replace parts anyway? Do they get the parts from Asmodee and then distribute these? If so, maybe I could reach out to a local or online game store to see about this? Or does Asmodee just assume the store has to issue a full return and not provide replacements?",FFG's new return policy--anyone used it yet?

552,boardgames,"Hi all, bit of a long post here. I really like Race for the Galaxy and Through the Ages but typically play them on their app versions. I am looking for a good solo tableau/engine builder to play with no need for an app/computer. I backed the recent Fantastic Factories Kickstarter, and was thinking of getting 51st State: Master Set as well for solo-only play and had a few questions:

\- Would you recommend it as a solo-only game, or only if I will play it multiplayer as well?  
\- Does anyone know where it is possible to buy it, or when it might be available again?  
\-  Are the expansions worthwhile? My understanding is that you can only use one expansion at a time e.g. New Era or Winter with the base game,  but not both  
\- For the Scavengers and Allies expansions, are these  similar to New Era and Winter i.e. just additional cards and no new  factions? Can you still only use one of these at a time? e.g. you can't  play a game with base+Winter+Scavengers, or base+Scavengers+Allies, etc?  
\-  Is the new Moloch expansion that is being released able to be played in the solo game or only multiplayer? Can this be mixed in with other  expansions or only with the base game?  
\- Do you find it a hassle to have to separate out the expansion cards when you want to play with a  different expansion? e.g. when you play a game with base+Winter cards  and then you want to play base+New Era/Scavengers/Allies, you have to  find all Winter cards and take them out of the deck before adding in the  New Era/Scavengers/Allies cards.  
\- There seem to be four additional  factions available: University, Mississippi, Texas, and Hegemony. Is  this correct? Do you recommend trying to get these too? Is it possible  to buy them anywhere? If not, do you know if they will become available  again?  
\- As a solo game, how good is the replay-value/replayability?  Once you beat the bot opponent with each of the factions using each deck  configuration (base+Winter, etc), do you find yourself still wanting to  play it solo?  
\- For solo games, how long is the set-up and tear down  time for the game?  I have read the bot is easy enough to run. Do you  find this to be the case?  
\- How much table space does a solo game require?  
\- Is there much of a ""take-that"" element in solo games?  
\- Any other thoughts you think are relevant?

559,boardgames,"Hey everybody, need help identifying a game please. I played it once with a buddy who is now deceased and I can’t remember the name. Below is the best description I have based on what I remember.

It was a card game (a deck builder I think) where you play as a wizard (or sorcerer/battlemage) and battle against other wizards. You picked one wizard that you could acquire gear and spells for which you would equip to your wizard, up to four pieces of gear. Your goal was to defeat the other wizard but there would be occasional encounters where you and the other wizard had to team up against a random monster.

To put gear on the character you slid it under one of the corners of your wizard card. There was no board for this game it was all cards. 

Furthermore the wizards had different domains they specialized in, earth, necromancy, and holy are the few examples I can remember. Their domain determined which spell cards they were proficient at using.

It has a base game and expansions too, my buddy and I played it back in December 2019.",Help me identify a game please?

Am i the only one that seems completely mystified by the TTS playthrough? Everyone seems to be going on about how the TTS while terribly run cleared up alot of their misgivings about the kickstarter.

I just don't feel this way at all. The game seems like its halfway through development. Why did they not show combat and how does it work? How do you even get into combat? Why did they not show any of the objectives for actually winning the game? Why is every question about the rulebook directed to the game designer with the phrase ""we can't get it right now"", do that mean its not finalised? or that its a hodepodge of good ideas from the video game?

For example, say I have two blue card to reduce the cost of playing an earth card. Can I combine the two blue cars to reduce the cost twice and then play the card? Or is that three actions and therefore impossible?

Another example, say I only have one blue card with a discount actions as before, and a second blue card that gives me gold when I play the same type of card. Intuitively I want to use the first blue card to play my earth card discounted, play the earth card as the second action, but then since I am playing the time of card that gives me gold (as my second blue card says), can I still do that action?

Sorry for silly question, but I have a problem with rules in Small World. My friend explained me Rules for Small World. He told me that scoring is done after all players played their turn and after that “first player is passed to next player”.

Could you tell me how do you handle scoring?:)",Scoring in Small World of Warcraft and Small World

597,boardgames,"Hi everyone,

My friends and I are thinking about playing Captain SONAR remotely over Table Top Simulator. We're trying to figure out the best way to handle voice communication. It would be easy enough to just set up two meetings, one for each team (I have access to Google Meet, MS Teams, and standard Zoom for video service and Discord for voice only).

I'm hoping for recommendations on how to handle the radio operator listening in on their conversation. Is it an option to have the each team on a different meeting client, and with a third one for all captains and radio operators? Would speakers / headsets work that way?

Or should we just stick to turn based play when we play remotely?",Captain SONAR playing remotely
598,boardgames,"Today I had a discussion with a friend about types of board games and what type of games requires which type of thinking. 

We were playing Fallout Shelter which is a worker placement games. I have a great dislike for these games because I am horrible at strategic planning since I can not keep an eye on all the different kinds of elements that generate resources and that does allow you to do all kinds of stuff. I can not plan 2 turns higher in my head. Also once you are behind, you can never win. This frustrates me. Also I suck at concentration which does not help.

Paradoxally I am very good at games that allow you to make a snap decisions with the current the possibilities that lie on the board. I often win games like Spendor, Its a wonderful world and TTR because I can see in just a second what I need to achieve what I want to achieve. It is the fact that Im good at adjusting at every moment without planning ahead that I win. If its fast paced, the more exciting it is.

Do I was wondering why I do enjoy the latter and not the first. What makes these kind of games different or similar? Im curious. Is this a right observation or do you have another opinion. Let me know!",Strategic vs Tactical Games

605,boardgames,"So I have been rewatching the original Yugioh series, and am now in the ""Dawn of the Duel"" arc in ancient Egypt. I realized that the shadow game being played between the Pharaoh and Bakura would make a really cool board game.

Here is a brief summary of the situation for those who either haven't seen it or need a refresher. The setting is ancient Egypt. On one side is the bad guy, Bakura, who is trying to summon Zorc, the lord of darkness, to envelop the world. In order to do this, he needs to collect the 7 millennium items and place them in a special tablet. The good guy, the Pharaoh, is trying to stop Bakura from collecting all 7 items to prevent Zorc from being summoned.

The 2 players essentially control multiple units on the game board (some are grunt units, and some are much more powerful). Each player also has unique once-per-game abilities. For example, Bakura has 3 special abilities: reverse time, freeze the movement of his opponent's pieces, and start an alternate countdown to summoning Zorc regardless of whether he collects all 7 items.

Both sides have grunt units, but the main battles focus on Bakura facing off against the Pharaoh's Court, which include the Pharaoh and 6 guardians, each of whom holds 1 millennium item. Bakura and the Pharaoh's Court are able to summon monsters to do battle against each other. Whenever someone's monster is injured or defeated, the monster's controller loses hp. When a unit's hp reaches 0, they are eliminated from the game.

Both sides have multiple win conditions: Bakura needs to either eliminate the Pharaoh, or successfully summon Zorc (which is not an instant win, but whose summoning is incredibly hard to overcome - similar to the end stage of Eldritch Horror). The Pharaoh either needs to defeat Bakura, or learn what his true name is, which is the key to defeating Zorc. 

Translating this to board game mechanics: the good guys are on a clock due to the alternate summoning condition of Zorc; however, Bakura might be able to summon it earlier, giving him a huge advantage. There would be an element of moving around the game board searching for clues to learn the Pharaoh's true name, as well as both sides fighting over control of the 7 items. There is also direct combat involving the players and their summoned monsters doing battle when they encounter each other on the board. Bakura starts off fairly strong, but each time he defeats an opponent, his monster grows stronger. This makes it harder and harder to defeat him in combat as the game progresses. Each player would have unique once-per-game abilities to gain a substantial advantage when used properly. I'm imagining this would be a grand strategy type game, with numerous strategies and goals being pursued.

In my research, War of the Ring comes closest to this idea. Frodo is trying to sneak around the board and destroy the Ring; Sauron is trying to get the Ring, but there is also a backdrop of area control and military conflicts.",Looking for a game that is similar to the final arc of the original Yugioh series!

615,boardgames,"Hey everyone,

I've been in the board gaming hobby ever since I was a kid. I played Avalon Hill games back in the 1990s. I remember being introduced to Settlers of Catan over 20 years ago. I remember attending my first board game convention (Gencon) back in 2005. It's been incredible to see the hobby explode and the production quality of board games skyrocket.

Anyway, I've always been a fan of rail games, including Ticket to Ride. And I'm someone who enjoys blinging out his games. I've upgraded my favorite games with metal coins, inserts, and in some cases, even painted minis. But I've always been disappointed that there weren't nice miniature trains that I could buy to upgrade the wooden and single-color plastic trains in my favorite rail games.

So, rather than just complaining about it, I decided to do something about it. After a year of work, I'm proud to have created **Deluxe Board Game Train Sets**. We launch on **Kickstarter** **April 6th**.

They're a line of five train sets, each highlighting a train style from a different period in railroading history. Each set comes in a metal tin with original artwork and contains 48 highly detailed, multicolored plastic trains and a stackable wooden score marker. We've been able to capture detail on these trains as small as .2mm (yes 2/10ths of a millimeter). The trains fit just about any train board game. And if you're a fan of Ticket to Ride, these trains fit any standard Ticket to Ride space and perfectly fit in the plastic insert that comes with any standalone Ticket to Ride game.

You can visit the website at [www.littleplastictrain.com](https://www.littleplastictrain.com) to be notified on launch day and automatically be entered in a drawing to win all five train sets (assuming we fund, of course). We've made full production samples of one of the sets--The Mercury--and uncolored prototypes of the other four trains. I've attached renders of those trains and their tins so you'll see what they'll look like when they're made.

Ugh, I know, that sounded like an ad. Sorry about that. I'm just excited to share what I've been working on nights and weekends for almost a year now and thought some on this subreddit might be interesting.

622,boardgames,"In Struggle of Empires 2-7 Players take the role of one of the major powers of the 18th century and fight in both Europe and the colonies over the course of three rounds (or wars). In each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other for the duration of that war.

At the end of each war, area control will be assessed in 11 territories and victory points will be awarded accordingly. Control is established by control markers which are mostly a fixed resource each game. Depending on the player count there will be a certain number of neutral markers placed on the board at the beginning of each war. Other than that, after the initial placement of player control markers at the beginning of the first war, control markers can only be gained by attacking other players’ control markers. If you win, their marker is removed and replaced by one of yours. 

There are a lot of choices that the game’s mechanics require you to make. First and foremost, since you cannot directly attack an ally, the auction mechanic dictates a lot of what you’ll be able to do during that particular war. Allies can (but are not required to) lend support to combat strength for allies during battles. Negotiation is encouraged and can lead to some interesting moments. The alliances also can affect your expansion decisions as well due to the location of each nation’s control markers and troops on the map. A hotly contested victory point region from one war might be completely silent in the next due to shifting alliances.

Gold and economy are super important and it always seems like there isn’t enough. If ever you do not have enough money for something you want to do, you must tax your population. For every 2 gold that you need, you most draw an unrest token, which is bad. Unrest tokens range from 0-2 with the vast majority of tokens being ones. 

If a player has 20 or more unrest at the end of the game, that player is eliminated. Players with less than 20 will lose victory points if they have the most or second most unrest at the end of the game. And since money and actions are so intertwined, unrest hangs over every decision you make.

There is luck involved and the dice can definitely crush you. But the dice rolling mechanic encourages you to build up your strength BEFORE rolling to increase your odds, because the dice can never increase your strength by more than 5 points. 

Struggle of Empires is not for the light-hearted gamer. But if you have a group that likes some intelligent fisticuffs, and can remain friendly after 4-5 hours of thoughtful strategy and quick, deadly combat, I bet you should have a lot of fun.

Here is also Roxiras story (I attached the main story line as picture below):

*Roxira arrived in Zuarell a few days ago together with her parents and brothers and sisters, after the FOG had driven them out of their home Londaryn over 2 weeks ago. The difficult journey into the unknown took them 10 days and they always saw and felt this huge, terrifying, and sinister FOG behind them on the horizon – as far as the eye could see. Once they had arrived in Zuarell they found accommodations in one of the many makeshift and overcrowded camps established and prepared for the great crossing.*

*She is just getting last provisions for the great crossing when suddenly great fear arises because the FOG is speeding up and people start running in pure panic towards the boats on the beach. In shock she dropped her basket and starts running as well and now she hopes desperately that her parents and brothers and sisters are also on their way and that they all will reach the boats in time. Suddenly she sees the packed beach ahead of her and gets even more desperate...*

647,boardgames,"I've played Monopoly on iOS for a couple of days, mostly because the PC platform is dead. Winning is pretty easy with average players and not so terrible luck (i. don't trade anything until the board is mostly bought up, ii. trade to gain leverage and 1 good monopoly). In the past few games, I've mostly been interested in a different way to play Monopoly - THE MOST VIOLENT AND TOXIC GAME, EVER. The idea is that instead of doing everything you can to fuck everyone over, keep the rent reasonable and have everyone grow in wealth overtime. 

In the last 2-3 games, I've basically obtained unbeatable positions (monopoly and funds for 3+ houses when no one else has anything similar), and tried to keep everyone in the game by donating funds, buying and then donating property to help everyone else get color sets, tearing down houses so that people can afford rent, etc. In the last game, there was an AFK player that was really annoying for the first half of the game but came back later, and I literally gave him both the brown and green sets for $1. And I did similar things for other players. 

The problem is, I've never had luck with making it work in the long run. A few people clearly got onboard with the idea, but there's usually one bad apple who start building as soon as he get any money even though there is ZERO threat on the board to him and everyone else is CLEARLY benign.

659,boardgames,"Tonight my wife and I played Fallout: Atomic Bonds for the first time, the cooperative expansion for the Fantasy Flight Fallout Board Game. Despite the mixed reviews the base game has received I was always fond of the “experience” you got fighting your way through the wasteland, exploring, leveling up, and working your way through the quest deck. As a competitive game, it never quite hit the ground running thanks to the unpredictable winning mechanic, (amongst other things!), and yet where the base game fell short—Atomic Bonds takes this game across the finishing line so well it’s a wonder Fantasy Flight didn’t launch with this rule set. Atomic Bonds is a fully cooperative expansion that quite literally transforms the Fallout Board Game into a more engaging and satisfying experience for those who might have been discouraged by the base game mechanics. In this expansion you side with one factions as you work your way through that faction specific quest line, as well as trying to complete an additional set of goals in order to win. Of course there are a few additional cards decks added to keep the game interesting such as mutation, modification, and workshop cards. You also gain a nifty assist die so that your fellow wastelanders can help out in combat (providing you stick close together). The addition of C.A.M.P. tokens allow your party to set up fast-travel way points for navigating larger maps more easily. Each of these additions corrects the flaws that were present in the base game and bolsters the best aspects to elevate the overall experience into something that you’ll want to bring to your gaming table time and again.

662,boardgames,"Hey everyone!  So I just bought the base set for Bloodborne’s board game as well as the Hunter’s Dream expansion, and while I’m super excited to dive into the game, I have some questions about the game itself (and I figure you smarty smart smarty people will more than likely have the answers):

1.  So for combat, I know that it’s dependent on the cards you use and whatnot.  Let’s say combat occurs against an enemy while I have two cards in hand, either from me attacking the enemy or from them pursuing me.  Also let’s assume I use the two cards in my hand for the fight, and both the enemy and myself still have health remaining after my cards are used up.

My first question is this: does the combat end at that point and go to end-of-turn procedures?  Or does the enemy just get to keep attacking me on that turn until I’m dead?  To my understanding, you can’t fight without putting down cards, and the rule book says you don’t get to draw a new hand unless it’s a new turn or when visiting the Hunter’s Dream.

2.  According to the rule book, if you have no available spaces on your weapon to play cards, you can’t fight the enemy and have to just take the blows.  I know that one of the actions you can take on your turn is discarding a stat card to transform your weapon, but similar to my first question, once the fight has started, if your slots are filled up, are you just stuck with the enemy attacking you over and over until you’re dead?

I know both of these questions sound similar, but I don’t think the idea of combat was explained super clear.  I get the idea of a back-and-forth fight, but nothing mentions what occurs in a fight when you’re out of cards, even if you have empty spaces on your weapon.  I’m sure the answer is something obvious, but I’d love some clarification!",Bloodborne Board Game questions!

I'm working on a University English assignment about a copy of *Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat* from \~1925, and written into it are some scores from a few different games the owners played. I was wondering if anybody would recognize what kind of game they would have been playing. 

The one I'm most interested in seems like the objective was to play four rounds, where each score has a maximum of 100 points, and you're trying to get as close to 400 as possible. In the first image you can see scores like 82, 90, 98, 94, adding to 364/400, and 82, 83, 89, and 75, adding to 329/400. The best score was 100, 100, 100, 99, for 399, but they're all recorded over 400 at the end. 

Another game they played seems to be three rounds, or maybe they only played 3; one person had scores of 12, 18, and 14 for a final of 44, and the other had scores of 21, 16, and 12, for a final of 49. This can also be seen in the first picture.

The last game is also the biggest longshot. In the picture they've kept track of wins/losses/draws for four (people? places?) entities. It's probably just some random folks' names, but if it jumps out at you let me know!

If any of that is even remotely familiar, please let me know what that seems like to you! Thanks for any and all help you can provide :)

677,boardgames,"Games like Risk, Unstable Unicorns, Here to Slay, Monopoly, and Red Dragon Inn are great, but they all rely a lot on luck. Even a board game like chess, you have to randomly or arbitrarily decide who goes first, which can be a noteworthy advantage. Are there any that are just strategy?

The only game I can think of is Stratego ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego)), except to decide who goes first, each player reveals a piece, and whichever is higher goes first (obviously players don’t want to reveal their 10, or may choose to go second by revealing a 2). Since players build their sides to protect their flag or deceive their opponent, this would be a perfectly strategic game (with a fitting name).

Two other potential examples people brought up to me were Battleship ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))) and Boggle ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle)).

My issue with Battleship is that there aren’t as strong of motivations when you’re placing pieces. Don’t put them next to each other, don’t put them in predictable places like corners. As a result, even though it isn’t truly random, firing off shells in a diagonal pattern can seem pretty aimless. Because there’s not as much room for actual strategizing, it ends up feeling random. It’s more wild guessing than educated guessing.

Boggle is basically just a single-player game where people compare scores, not so much a strategy game.

Another kind of game that could work are social deduction Mafia-esque ones where players have to lie convincingly or deduce who’s telling the truth. I’d like to omit these because players are randomly assigned roles and there are a ton of them.

TL;DR Most board games involve some sort of luck. Are there any that don’t? Thanks.",Are there any purely strategic board games?

ANYWAYS, what blew me away is how connected all the cards are. Every card has a purpose? How do they do that? For example, Maleficent needs to start the round with 4 courses in each realm. How did the designers come up with the cards to support it? Do you think they first came up with the final objective and then working backwards built all the cards for it? REALLY COOL!

689,boardgames," I'm referring to board games, of course.

The groups I play with number at least 4 and frequently have more people. But the games we've been playing recently have a max of 5 players (Wingspan, Carcassonne, Tokaido). This means we ended up having to have some people pair up to play as one player. Yes, I know the idea might horrify some. But it's easier to do that than to try and split up a group of casual gamers, in my experience.

What's the size of your usual group? Do you face problems playing the games you want to play due to player numbers?

Hello redditors :D

My friends and I are fresh out of university board games creators who are currently working on innovative strategic card/board game called PIG (Politically Incorrect Game).

PIG gameboard is coming in hot and soon will be avaible on kickstarter. It tells a story of a parallel world in which aliens rule over the Earth and make peoples life’s miserable. Humans tired of living in chains decided it’s time to break them, starting the greatest and most absurd war in the history of time.

Game is made in a humorous fashion and we would like to make sure it will be translated correctly into English and we don't lose the essence of ""PIG"". So we are looking for translators, need experienced English speakers, but what's more important for us, people who have an uncanny sense of humour, love for internet memes, conspiracy theories, political and popculture jokes and are able to laugh at yourself. Generally cool people ;)

If you intrested reach out to us on reddit or via e-mail: [invisible.hand.entertainment@gmail.com](mailto:invisible.hand.entertainment@gmail.com)

Stay tuned ;)

I love co-op games because it's a good kind of stress, solving things together or working towards a puzzle or goal that isnt another person. I'm good at that sort of thing; puzzles, risk management, odds calculation, strategy, so I'm very good at co-op or solo games. 

The problem is i'm very aware of this and even though I have the right answer It's hard for me to choose when to present it or when to let them solve it (Knowing their answer is wrong).

I don't want to sound narcissistic but I believe it's important to recognize your strengths as well as your weaknesses.

I want to win these games with my friends and I don't want to throw the game because I don't want to quarterback and cause them to have less fun, but winning together is also part of the fun and part of the fun for me as well. Trying your hardest and succeeding is a great feeling as a team.

I want to know about anyone's thoughts on this. Does anyone have the same problem being ""too good"" at something and not giving it your all? How would you feel if a player did this, being an opponent or a team mate.   


Just to clarify, I'm not talking about picking up people's pieces and moving them and telling them thats the best move - next turn. I mean when an obstacle is presented you know the best option for that situation (You know how many cards are left in the deck, you know which way the AI will move the monster and they didnt think of that, You are good at math or riddles so those last 5 escape room questions were already solves) most of the time.",How to be less of a co-op quarterback?

729,boardgames,"tldr; there are no real official rules on character selection, right?

First off, having an absolute blast with this game.  But after losing twice in January and worrying we were doing something wrong to make it too hard on ourselves, we have won 5 straight and I am worried we are doing something wrong to make it too easy on ourselves.  I love an unforgiving game and frankly miss the January days of getting our asses beat.

Granted, we did come *very* close to losing in June, our first 0-funding game &gt;!(also our first game with the expiremental vaccines, but we didn't even use any)!&lt;.

But, specifically, the last 5 games (Or at *least* the last 3, going off memory) we have used the same 3 characters.  &gt;!Operations Specialist, Quarantine Specialist, and Medic (apologies if those aren't the exact names).  Along the way we've unlocked the Soldier and Colonel but, while we definitely see their value in dealing with faded figures, we've luckily been able to keep that situation pretty well under control so far.!&lt;

With that combo of characters, though, this game that was once kicking our ass has been relatively simple, although I do feel we've gotten a little lucky in some regards.

So, my general question is -- am I missing any rules about character selection?  I realize that if there's not but we still wanted to challenge ourselves we could just pick different characters, *but* (and here's where I'll cop to being a bit of a stinker) the main group I play with likes an easy win and I like more of a challenge.  If I pitch a ""let's mix it up for a challenge"" it won't go well and I'll happily cede to the group, but if I were to realize ""we shouldn't be allowed to run the same 3 characters every month, per the rules"" they'll happily acquiesce to that (the same way I'd happily acquiesce to the majority's wishes if there is no such rule).

Thanks everybody!

Also a very minor question not worth including in the tldr but is bugging me, and...since I'm here (also big apology because I am doing this from memory and likely have some details wrong); &gt;!Operations Guy doesn't need to discard a card to build a military base.  The ""Formidable"" upgrade means you can discard an adjacent city card to build a structure, instead of \*that\* city's card.  When drunkenly deciding on upgrades, we decided that meant since Operations Guy doesn't need a card to build a structure, period, ""Formidable"" would mean he could build a structure in an adjacent city for an action, the same way he could in the city he was in.  This is a nonsense reading, right?  I think we basically wasted Formidable on the 1 character who truly does not need it.  It's saying you can use an adjacent city's card instead of the city-you-are-in's card, but he doesn't need a card at all so...womp.  Right?!&lt;",Pandemic Legacy Season 1 [Spoilers Through June]

I see a lot of people saying ""alpha-gaming is about poor social interactions"" and/or ""alpha-gamers need to just not be alpha-games.""  It seems to me that we need to go deeper to talk about this.

There are two types of alpha gamers (AG) here:  
Type 1) Inept or inexperienced group gamers--they don't know either how to manage the information they share, or how to negotiate social interactions in a group game.  These are both learned skills, but they are social skills rather than gaming skills.  This group often contains people who are just not pleasant to play with because of the way they interact with others in condescending, controlling, or otherwise inappropriate ways.  Some do this deliberately (and that is another problem worth talking about) but many just don't understand their impact on others.  
Type 2) Skill differential in gaming--some gamers are more experienced, more tactically-minded, more familiar with the game at hand, etc.  Even if these gamers are exceptionally adept at negotiating social situations and group gaming, they can still cause problems simply because they are operating on a different level than those they play with.  **This skill differential is what I want to talk about.**

---

Full disclosure: I tend to be an alpha gamer (in the second sense, although I'm sure I'm not always a perfect person to play with in the first sense).  Regardless of the games we play, unless there is a high degree of randomness, I tend to have a win-rate of 70% or better.  It doesn't matter who I play with or how many players I play with, that rate remains fairly constant.  The first time I played Race for the Galaxy, I won--over the person who owned the game and taught it to us.  Connected to this is that I tend to be the rules-lawyer in my groups.  I have pointed out rules errors in games I have never played simply because I have a strong meta-understanding of games.  I notice something that seems inconsistent with the game design and call it out.

Most people would call me highly intelligent, but I believe most of my skill comes down to experience.  I have been playing games of various sorts for my entire life and I am familiar with how they are structured and how to negotiate and manipulate the elements of a game system to excel.  This is not to brag, but simply to give some context.

---

**My problem is this:**

*Many people blame alpha players for disrupting group dynamics and ""ruining"" the fun for other players.  While this may be appropriate for Type 1 AG, it is not appropriate for Type 2 AG (Skill Differential).*  This is the equivalent of saying ""My fun in gaming depends on not encountering any player who is substantially more skilled than me.  If a player is substantially more skilled, they should keep that to themselves in order to allow me to enjoy the game.""  Now, this might be a legitimate solution to the problem if *all* players can agree to it (the same as a parent choosing to play Candyland with a child).  However, **if the person in question is simply better at gaming and looking to test and grow that skill, it is unfair to expect them to consistently sacrifice that experience for the sake of the group.  This is cutting off the tall poppy.**  In competitive gaming, this can turn into aggressive attacks against that player simply because ""they always win.""  While this might be effective at preventing their win, it can easily turn into bullying--targeting a player simply because they are perceived as superior, regardless of their performance from game to game.  In co-operative gaming, there are no obvious ways to ""cripple"" this player, so the general response seems to be that they should cripple themselves in order to allow for others enjoyment.  This hardly seems fair or productive.  One might suggest that the other players should take the opportunity to learn how to work with someone how is simply better at a thing then they are.  

If you are at work, and someone who has been doing the job for years starts telling you how to improve, you should listen.  It doesn't mean you should let them walk on you, but they are sharing their experience in hopes of seeing you learn and grow in your work.  The same applies to gaming.  Sometimes people tell you what to do because they don't know any better or because they like telling others what to do (Type 1), but sometimes they are doing so in order to share what they've learned and see you excel (Type 2).  Distinguishing these two modes is a critical life skill.  Conversely, some people are offended when anyone demonstrates greater competency than them--whether they perceive it as limiting their choices, or they simply cannot admit their limitations. This is hardly more adaptive.  **Healthy social interaction requires learning to negotiate differences of skill, commitment, experience, passion and social awareness.  This goes both ways.**

Now, there are a few things I've learned that help me play better with others:  
First, as many have noted, put that energy and experience to use in teaching and guiding other players into new play experiences.  This may involved participation, but it might also mean simply teaching others to play a game for themselves.  However, this may be limited by group size and by the desire for participation rather than just supervising others.  Sometimes I just want to play a game.

Second, set artificial limits on your play.  (This is something I've learned from training longsword with masters far more skilled than myself).  If you are interacting with someone less skilled than yourself, recognize that and decide what you want to gain from the experience.  Often, I will set out to pursue a strategy I have never tried before, simply to see if I can make it work.  Of course, this means I prefer games which support fairly open-ended game play rather than tightly reactive/problem-solving types of games.  (I regularly win at Agricola, but I can't stand how it demands very specific, sequenced gameplay.  I much prefer things like Race for the Galaxy, Great Western Trail or Terraforming Mars.)  **Instead of focusing simply on winning, focus on expanding your knowledge of the game.  Continue to be curious about what is possible.**  This may mean certain games simply aren't worth your time--and that is another challenge to negotiate with a group.

---

As a highly skilled gamer, it is difficult to find opponents who consistently challenge me.  Part of negotiating this with various gaming groups has meant open conversations about the kinds of gaming experiences we find enjoyable.  Some games allow for experimentation and others demand more reactive gameplay.  Figuring out what works for everyone takes effort.  Part of the reason we love games is because they bring us together, but this social aspect to gaming requires effort and learning, as well.  If your dynamics are difficult because of an alpha gamer, it is worth asking whether you are being a supportive and positive group member, rather than simply assuming they are they problem because they are better than you.  Their behaviour may be problematic, but yours may be as well.  Negotiating this tactfully and respectfully is something gaming allows us to practice in a variety of contexts.  **Try varying your games and looking for experiences that help each person to grow.**

TL;DR - Sometimes ""alpha gamers"" are jerks, but sometimes they are simply excellent players.  Expecting excellent players to play in a mediocre way to allow you have fun is not fair.  If you can't have fun because someone in the room is smarter or more competent than you, that is your problem, not theirs.  Learning to negotiate that skill differential is part of the social learning and experience of gaming with others.  Honest conversations about what we're each looking for is important to healthy gaming, or any social interaction.",Negotiating Skill Differentials in Gaming

792,boardgames,"I recently picked up Mansions of Madness as a longtime fan of Arkham Horror LCG and overall I really enjoy the game. I'm typically not one to houserule games, but I've noticed that there seem to be lots of folks houseruling MoM, so I'm looking for feedback regarding one gripe I have with the game. 

Horror checks at the end of each mythos phase tend to a) slow the game down, and b) feel like adding insult to injury (yes, I know it's Lovecraft, I'm well-versed in being slapped around by the mythos phase in Arkham LCG). In MoM, each mythos phase tends to include a mythos event, followed by monster movement/attacking, and ending with horror checks. It just feels like one thing too many - and it doesn't help that, playing 3-handed solo, I'm often doing 2 or 3 dice rolls in the process. 

I don't necessarily want to do away with the horror checks entirely (especially since I enjoy the Insane mechanic), but I just want to streamline things a bit. After a bit of brainstorming, here's what I came up with:

*""Horror checks are only performed if a monster occupies your space or an adjacent space. If a horror check is skipped as a result of this rule change, the monster in range with the highest horror rating moves 1 space toward the nearest investigator.""* 

I haven't played with this rule yet, and it will probably need to be modified slightly to avoid instances where a monster would move out of a space with an investigator. The free movement is there as a way to balance things a little. 

Then there's the slash-and-burn option, which is likely to be less balanced but improves game tempo a bit more: 

*""Skip horror checks entirely. If one or more monsters occupy the same room as an investigator, that investigator takes 1 facedown horror.""*

802,boardgames,,Everdell with Bellfaire exp. Fav. new mechanic?
803,boardgames,"First of all, let me preface this by saying a few things. 
I am pretty critical of game design and mechanics and pretty jaded/pessimistic of new releases - especially Kickstarters which tend to be flashy but ultimately mediocre gameplay wise.

Although I like to play mostly anything (barring just straight up bad games and co-ops) my favourite games are low luck euros and economic/financial sims (18xx/Splotters).   
   
Bullet&lt;3 is none of these and yet is feeling like a strong 9/10 and rapidly shooting up to my fav games of all time.      
   
Bullet&lt;3 is inspired by the colourful and intense Japanese bullet hell SHMUP arcade games (specifically the magical heroines of Touhou) and while its visuals and Spotify OST (which is incredible and adds so much to the play experience) convey that aesthetic, if I were to describe what it's like to play I'd actually say its a mix of  
- The push your luck, draw from a bag and potentially bust tension feel of Quacks of Quedlinburg    
- The intense real time, spatial, arcade puzzle game feel of Tetris/Bust A Move/Peggle/Candy Crush/Bejeweled
and relatedly
- The addicting, satisfying feel of combos and clearing obstacles of classic arcade puzzle games like the ones aforementioned 
    
Players have their own personal bag filled with random chits (the titular ""bullets"") that have both a colour (5 different colours) and a number on ranging from 1 to 4. These chits are super chonky wooden tokens in the deluxe edition - think of the Quacks acrylic geekbits then multiply them by 1.5   

On your turn you can draw a bullet and place it in your grid in the xth column (where x is the colour of the chit), y spaces down (where y is the number on the chit). Naturally as you place more bullets of the same colour, the column will fill up and overflow - bullets that overflow deal damage and if you take too much damage you die/lose.    
   
The main way to clear these bullets out of your grid is by playing pattern cards, which require bullets of certain colours/numbers to be in a specific pattern/formation in your grid. Some bullets have a star on them and clearing those out of your grid will reward you with refilling your action points. Action points are a precious resource you can use to trigger powerful abilities (some unique to your character) like drawing more pattern cards and (very frequently used) manipulating the position of already placed bullets in order to set up for the pattern cards in your hand.   
   
The first twist I like?   
Bullet&lt;3 is played in REAL-TIME in successive rounds where you receive more and more bullets that inevitably overflow your board and kill you. Every decision feels like it has weight and every time you play a pattern card and clear bullets it is eminently satisfying.  
    
Admittedly the game only has a teensy bit more player interaction than Quacks (mostly heads down on your own board with random exclamations of cheers/groans) save for this brilliant second twist: bullets you clear move into your opponents bag for the next round (much like sending lines in Tetris) and the last player standing wins! (in the standard competitive mode, there's also solo ""time attack"", co-op ""boss"" and 2v2 team mode).  
   
Bullet&lt;3 is simple, intense and satisfying. Managing your limited action points to set up for maximum value clearing pattern cards is such a STRONG gameplay hook. The real-time push your luck aspect is just icing on the cake for me and my tastes personally. Drawing more bullets out of the bag makes patterns easier to achieve and clear but also brings you closer to death. There are 8 different characters with VERY unique playstyles that feel interesting, rewarding to learn and master and substantially asymmetric. If you enjoy any the puzzle arcade titles I listed above you will LOVE Bullet&lt;3. It reminds me of the time I got introduced and subsequently addicted to playing PVP Tetris online. Ultimately this still feels like its own unique game with its own fledgling IP.   
   
I'm a fan of anime but not really into anime art for my boardgames. The quality of the art in this game however is excellent. Better than most games based of actual Anime IPs. It is sharp and bright, reminding me of a neon lit arcade machine. The graphic design is clean and superb in QoL for usability for players. You know its good graphic design when just looking at the game set up makes you already have a gist of how it plays and gets you excited to play it.    
   
Finally it's the little touches that just make this game the total package for me. How each pattern card has campy ridiculous Japanese-anime-yell-your-attack-as-you-perform-it burning booster v.01 no jutsu name with a silly anime one liner flavour text. How each heroine (8 in the base game, apparently more to come?!) has its own theme in the Spotify OST. How the playable characters have a b-side that becomes a thematic boss which mirrors their asymmetric ability playstyle in the co-op mode. 
  
Playing this game made me feel happy as a gamer/consumer because I could feel the amount of work and attention that went into this game from the designer and publishers.   

I seriously recommend you give this game a try. I saw many people on this sub overlook this game citing distaste for the art (fair enough - anime isn't for everyone) but this is a solid and satisfying competitive real-time puzzle game that feels unique to any other board game I've played. It's impressive how well they've translated this digital video game genre onto analogue tabletop. 

My final point is that I played this on Tabletop Simulator before I backed it. I thought it was neat enough to back and was a fan of Level 99s stuff anyway but didn't think too much of it later. Playing it in person is completely different with the tactility of the bullets in the bag (especially the big wooden chonks) adding so much. Finally the game is easy to teach, set-up/pack-up and play-time is literally &lt;20 mins since each round is timed. It completely caught me off guard by how much I enjoyed it since it feels like it came out of the blue and has just made me excited about what board games (ofc Level 99 games and this IP) continue to have to offer when I thought I'd seen mostly everything (Worker placement deckbuilding for spring...?

830,boardgames,"One of my favorite board games is 7 Wonders Duel, as I love the idea of having multiple ways to win, through military, science, or victory points.

Of course, the game comes down to VPs usually, but I love the feeling of having the play multiple fronts to prevent the opponent from getting too strong in military or science to get the win. It creates a sort of balancing act where sometimes you have to play sub-optimally and refocus your attention to one of those fronts just to deny that advantage to your opponent. But if you focus too hard on one of the fronts, your opponent might just snatch the win from underneath you through a different one.

The idea of different victory conditions and having to balance multiple things, dividing your focus, is a really appealing game mechanic to me, but I'm surprised that more games don't do it. Or at least, I can't seem to find them.

Aside from drafting and deckbuilding games, are there any other games that have this ""balancing multiple fronts"" ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

Star Wars The Queen's Gambit seems to have this idea, with 4 literal fronts you have to focus on for advantage, but given its price point, I don't think I'll ever play it in my lifetime.

I was looking into Risk: Star Wars Edition too with its 3 fronts, but some of the fronts seem like afterthoughts and the strategy seems too basic.

Open to any suggestions! Or at least a discussion of this mechanic in board gaming!",Games with Multiple Fronts/Win Conditions?

With the Everdell kickstarter going on right now, I was wondering what the experience of playing with all the expansions was like. With 250+ critter/building cards (from the kickstarter page), it seems very unlikely to actually get those critter+building combos. I remember back in the day in reviews of the base game only, people were complaining about the luck factor and having a high chance of a combo you were hoping for not coming up. Is this something that's accentuated as more cards are added, and would you say it has detracted from your enjoyment of the game?

For me, I am a huge fan of the PC game and the art assets look really well translated. I don't have a 4X game in my collection, and the fact that the 2-hour playing time is a highlight is encouraging. The price is what I expect, so I am neutral on that. 

Now the cons have been mounting up as I watched the page:
- no rulebook
- no gameplay/review vids
- very little explanation to what is in the expansion boxes
- the fact their stretch goals have jumped from $70k to $500k(with the one following that being $800k) just feels dirty. They did not expect to be so big on day one, but it just feels like they either didn't have enough stretch goals planned out or they are trying to milk out as much as possible.

Before I continue I want to so these channels are amazing and the success they have received is well earned and I love their content. However in the Reviews/Previews and other content that gets posted here a VERY small amount of them feature PoC creators and I think this is an issue at least worth discussing.   


Very often we talk about how inclusive the hobby is and how its for everyone. /r/ boardgames rightfully displays the hobby's wide array of games out there and with all the unique combinations of systems and themes anyone can be welcomed into the hobby. Boardgames themselves have a diverse history from the old style Euro games, Ameritrash take-that or the small micro game trend that came from Japanese game designers.   


However, if we have games that come from anywhere and preach about how anyone can play games then how come our content creators do not share this variety?   


Yes there are in general there are fewer PoC creators and it would be silly for me to expect a perfect balance that reflects national population breakdowns. However maybe we should be asking ourselves whey we don't see creators from X ethnic group meanwhile new white creators keep surfacing on a regular basis.   


Dice Tower and SUSD have been doing a great job with diversifying their teams and its great seeing a whole host of diverse faces during major Dice Tower panels however I think this is a conversation worth having.","SUSU's latest review of Paleo talked about inclusion in board game spaces with that in mind, why are there only a small amount of content creators PoC?"

932,boardgames,"Example: We played the Back to the Future board game, Back in Time, and at first my friends hated it, because they said ""Biff activates too often and it's nearly impossible to win except by luck.""

Well, I tried showing them the strategy I had employed before, that of making sure that you ALWAYS spare at least one action during each player's turn to simply move George and/or Lorraine around the board, to keep them away from Biff. (They had been going all out with their actions, trying to scoop up the DeLorean parts and fight Biff and such). We also stopped ignoring the opportunities to get more Powers, which helped A LOT. And just like that, the game became winnable (still a challenge, but beatable).

Can you guys think of any game that was utterly ruined and had people going ""This is stupid, I hate this game"" only because they weren't employing a key strategy throughout? Or, a game that you KNOW your friends would've liked if they had just played it a little differently, and seen a different aspect to the game?","Is there a single strategy in any one game that you know about that, if others realized it, they would probably like the game better?"

945,boardgames,"Tabula Games is coming out with a new standalone game within the Mysthea Universe. Many previous titles like Mysthea, Icaion, Mysthea: The Fall, and Volfyirion also connect to this same world giving players many games to play with similar lore. Volfyirion Guilds is a fast-paced deck building game for 2 players and plays around 20-40 minutes. Again, this is a standalone game, so players will not need to own any previous titles, but it also can be combined with Volfyirion amplifying the classic game.

**The Story**

Volfyirion Guilds takes placed immediately after the events included in the game Volfyirion and about 60 years before the events in the game Mysthea.

This story focuses on 5 major guilds, all created by the king of Mysthea. In the beginning, these guilds were both small and big Houses formed to pursue the common goal. It’s important to know that one of these biggest and elite guilds was formed and managed by the Volarees family, even though there were also many other smaller families associated with this guild. With time, the system that the king created brought a silent war of power among these guilds, with the focus on the Volarees Guild. 

Disputes arose between between guilds and the strength of Volarees increased more and more with other guilds or houses disappearing including Rorius house. The king being a visionary and intelligent man knew it was time for a political challenge. He empowered other guilds, making sure that Volarees would not be the only powerful force inside his kingdom. His purpose was to divide the power accumulated by the Volarees House without releasing retaliations that could potentially undermine the entire political stability of his kingdom. Before the king made a huge move, he studied out the dynamics between the various families of Ilvash including their passions and weaknesses that could change the entire challenge. 

The story continues as a new Qoam field is discovered at the bottom of one oof the farthest floating islands of Mysthea that hosted a very unique flower. Telron, a talented young Qoam manipulator identified unique properties within the petals of that flower. When those petals are turned into pulp and then burned, it produces fumes that induces divinatory powers when inhaled. Telron was granted ownership of the new field from the scholar guild, and Volaress claimed ownership for the discovery. 

Both the scholar guild and Volaress discussed ownership of this new discovery with one side claiming the importance of studying it and the other the property rights of it. The king saw this and decided to rebalance powers among the guilds redistributing lands forming 5 guilds: *Varorin the Guild of Merchants, Volarees the Guild of Nobility, Lusma the Guild of Faith, Kaetur the Guild of Soldiers, Magista the Guild of Scholars*.

Years later the guilds fight for power using guerrilla and sabotage techniques. With time, luxurious palaces were transformed into command centers and were called Vaults for the secrets that were stored inside them. With time it was then mandatory to enroll in one of the guilds that represented that citizen's interests. But with these changes, fighting between guilds for political and economical power arose ignoring the real needs of the population. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Mechanics**

Volfyirion keeps all the mechanics used in the base game with an addition giving the game more depth. The game includes 110 new cards including new card types, new abilities, and some additional mechanics. 

The main engine in the game is a system that uses points. Each card that’s played provides a combination of points, and during a turn the player can spend those points to perform actions. 

In the game there are three types of points: command, wonder, and knowledge. Each of these points will allow for different actions to take place. Each player will start with the same cards but players will refine their deck to match their strategy to win the game. In addition, the cards have a system of colors that offer synergies to trigger powerful combinations and unleash chain effects. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6svsa1ab0bm61.png?width=2418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e06eb9d6c39c606636c1dd800230e750d2b49e6

**What’s New with the Mechanics?**

If you are familiar with the base game, then you might be wondering how this game differs form that one. Volfyirion Guilds introduces two new card types: Agents, and Vaults. These card types also introduce new mechanics into the game. 

*Agents* – these cards will carry out delicate tasks for the guilds to perform. These cards also help reduce the randomness of the deckbuilding, helping to find ways to acquire certain cards and to improve the management of that turn.

*Vaults* – These are the most important areas of a guild’s command center. They contain all the secrets and valuables for that guild. These cards enhance the strategies and choices for players, but also remove the whims in seeking the conditions to trigger a specific combo. But these all come with a cost, as the vault’s abilities are unlocked when their owner loses a city. This helps the player who is at a disadvantage to be able to catch up to the runaway leader leading to a more balanced match. 

**Ways to Play the Game**

Remember Volfyirion is a standalone game but can still be combined with the base game Volfyirion. As would be expected, if combining the game, it will change the game giving players different actions and an increased variety of cards. 

Also, like the base, solo and coop modes will be available with a renewed feel to them. It will be possible to not only face Volfyirion creatures but also other creatures of Mysthea. The game will come with tarot cards the include the specific rules for these modes. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2c3eof4d0bm61.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50b3eb2c014ea4b8e8279937a671433367eda47b

**Highlights of the Game**

It’s a fast-paced game that only lasts 20-40 minutes with intense turns of lots of actions and decisions. The game is easy to learn and takes almost no time to setup yet hard to master as the game is highly strategic and every choice with have a significant impact on the turnout of the game.  The game is also highly replayable and isn’t repetitive as you can choose to play your cards in many different ways combining cards to create synergies and focusing on different paths to victory. The new features in this game will increase the depth of an already very well-liked game adding in new cards with new abilities and new mechanics. 

Again, you can play Volfyirion Guilds as a standalone game, or combine it with the base game Volfyirion causing a different gameplay, you can play solo, or competitive. Additional content and extra rules are going to be released during the Kickstarter campaign, so we can hope for some nice surprises as well. 

**The Dragon Miniature**

Word has been passed down that the 120mm dragon miniature will also be available not only for those interested in backing Volfyirion Guilds but to anyone interested in the dragon miniature itself.

**Art**

The art is done by Travis Anderson with 4 additional illustrators including Andrea Butera. The complete collection of illustrations will be available in a Volfyirion Guilds Artbook.

**Price Point**

The base game is 14€ which is $16.69. This includes 110 cards + Volfyirion Token + 4 Tarots for solo/multiplayer mode + Rulebook. 

**The Box**

The box will include a tray that separates spaces for the main deck, the additional cards and the iconic dragon meeple. The box will be different than the first card game as it will be horizontally oriented and made of a thicker material. The size will let the game be portable and easy to bring along to play in so may places without filling up more room than needed on your board game shelf. There will also be deluxe collector's box available that contain the base game, the old Volyirion and the 2 expansions and will solve functional requirements for those who like sleeves, playmats, and supporting the tokens and components.

**Is It Safe to Back a Game From Tabula Games?**

Amazon is the only option I currently have, as all the FLGS in my area are completely sold out. Is this because there is a new edition coming out soon? Or would that just be Covid related difficulties?

951,boardgames,"I played Mysterium for the first time yesterday, expecting to have a great time seeing all the wonderful reviews. My excitement quickly turned into panic after my  role as ghost was found very difficult. The cards I picked, and even the new cards after dumping my hand, were not good at first glance. I found myself mulling over which cards to pick while everyone sat watching me and doing nothing. The whole game ended up with me panicking, trying to pick a card while the psychics were bored out of their minds - my mom expressed this openly which made me more anxious to pick cards. I eventually started shuffling through the whole deck trying to pick a card that made any sense for the psychics to interpret. The whole thing was a complete disaster, and I walked away angry at my mom for being such a bad sport and angry with myself for buying such a boring game. 

I really don’t want to regret buying this game. It was expensive as hell, and there’s been so many good reviews. What am I doing wrong? Did anyone else feel the same about Mysterium?",Mysterium: Hard Being the Ghost?

I searched for about an hour or two all over the place, i am ready to ask for help (hence this post).

- Wikipedia has nothing. Like, here is a [wikia](https://myth-board-game.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page). Please, click on that and look at their 'latest news' block. If you go to the [boardgamegeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140519/myth/forums/63) website you will find many reviews from about half a decade ago. It just died.

- You can buy a version of the game for about $300 or so? It is no longer made. So there.

- It was loved by some but hated by any casual or 'party' TableTop gamer. Apparently D&amp;Ders considered it to be a gateway game? It was said to be better than [Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent:_Journeys_in_the_Dark) but not as good as the great and almighty GrandMaster [GloomHaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloomhaven), that board game for which none of us are truly worthy / could ever finish all the scenarios.

- this thing started as a kickstarter and survived. The 'retail' version of this game, 2.0, had updated rules that were still confusing and contradictory (and was missing the quests from their first game version apparently). 

- the four guys who made it were from a miniatures company - they looked young, they could not all be dead (possibly eaten... or stolen by aliens for a deep and thorough probing?)

If someone could let me know what the HECK happened to this game i would be most thankful. Surprised, even. It is weird that a game did so incredibly well and when the collective audience said 'we love it, just fix the rules a bit' the publisher said... 'naw... we don't really like fame, money, fans nor have any interest in self-respect'. Okay then!",What happened to 'Myth: The Boardgame' this decade?

Gameplay reminds me of Betrayal at House on the Hill, with the castle being built by randomized tiles, plenty of supernatural events, and special items to help fight the monsters along the way. The main difference is that it's co-operative to the very end, with no backstabbing or sudden rule changes for the endgame.

It's got a cute art style and comes from Japanime Games &amp; DelightWorks. From what I understand, the game released in Japan in 2018 but has been unavailable in English or other languages until now.

I was wanting to buy one of these for me and my partner. Ive looked into the rules for both games but still have a few questions about them.
If i just compared the base games, which would be better for: 
2 players
Has more strategic decisions
Has less luck
Has more replayability

I get that eldritch is more like a one shot puzzle which drastically changes each time while arkham is more about the progressing story but can arkham be played like a one shot rather than a campaign (continuing into other expansions) where replaying the base game will give different game decisions?

977,boardgames,"Sometime during quarantine I hit close to critical mass in my collection. I don't have that many games left on my wish list, so I started to allocate my funds into blinging out/upgrading my favorite titles. Part of that was creating inserts. 

While I'm not opposed to bags (as you can see in the pics) I hate them for components. Players unloading their own pieces isn't a big deal, but I wanted everything else to be easy. These greatly reduced setup/tear down in such a huge way I can't see myself going back. 

When I get a game now, I factor in creating an insert as part of the cost. I have quite a few games to go, but I thought I'd post my early work and give a few tips for others who want to give it a try. 

It's really not as hard or as intimidating as you think!

Materials used: Pins (with round heads), Elmer's All-Glue, Cutting Mat, Stainless Steel Ruler

What's Next: Rising Sun KS (oh, boy), Great Western Trail, The Others Core Box, Mission Red Planet, Lord of the Rings Journeys in Middle Earth.

Quick Tips:

Don't spend a ton of time measuring out your cuts. You don't need to draw out lines either. Just be careful about lining things up, do a small practice line to get a groove, and then do a finished cut with a good amount of force.

Glue a small piece of foamcore under flat cards or carboard player boards. Makes them much easier to get out.

Plan. Plan. Plan. Creating a blueprint for your insert is often one of the trickiest parts of putting together a box. In fact, for Blood Rage and Quest for El Dorado the plan took almost as long as putting everything together. Be meticulous here. Everything should have a place before you glue anything together. 

When planning don't forget to measure the board and rules. You do not want to get everything together only to find out the board sticks up out of the box. Trust me.

When gluing I go a little heavy with big drops and then smear them on the surface with my finger. I find this creates a better seal for the finished product. Just be sure to keep a rag/paper towel handy.

While you can use books to weigh things down, I like to use pins to hold everything together while the foam dries. This largely comes down to personal preference, but I found pins to be a bit tighter and more accurate in the end.

My biggest tip: When cutting pieces, always cut bigger than you need and shave down. This allows you to get a tight fit without too much risk. Going a bit long for walls or cutting wider (and sloppier) for bottoms just to get a smaller piece to work with is extremely useful. I found trying to perfectly measure the first cut leads to issues (and a lot of wasted foamcore). I typically cut a wall about two or three times. It takes longer, but is worth it if you want clean pieces.

1020,boardgames,"I think a few of us in Oz will be looking at Game Steward to buy some games that are hard to find locally if you missed a Kickstarter. I recently bought some stuff from them and thought I'd share my experience for others.

Price: bought Honey Buzz Deluxe Version, that version wasn't available locally and retail was still not available. Based on prices I'm seeing online, I paid $100 above the base game retail price to get the extra stuff + shipping. Having said that, this was a relatively light and small package, so shipping will go crazy with larger packages.

Time to Delivery: took exactly a month from the day I made the purchase and arrived at my door. It 10 calendar days from the shipping status to change from 'Received shipping information' to 'In transit to destination'. So hard to tell whether the package was dispatched at any point during those 10 days or if it took them 10 days to get the package picked up.

Having said the above, at the time of purchase, COVID was going wild in the states and it was winter, and some of the worst winter storms were hitting parts of the US. I'm not sure if that contributed to longer shipping times than normal, but they must've been a factor. Mine was shipped with the cheapest postage option. Maybe in normal times you might get your package in like 10 business days or something.

Packaging: It was pretty well packaged, they use bubble wrap where each bubble is like the diameter of our 20 cent coins. The box itself looked fairly banged up, especially the edges, but due to the good packing, all the contents were fine.

Conclusion: Shipping times aside (which again, lots of stuff going on in the US when I bought it so definitely a factor) pretty happy with the results. If the game you want isn't available anywhere but the US, based on my experience, I'd say you can trust them. Might cost you a lot, but at least everything should arrive in good shape.",Game Steward Experience (Shipping to Australia)

1024,boardgames,"Hey fellow boardgamers,

I've been in the hobby since high school, so I've had about 8 years of on and off experience with board games. I've played about 50 different board games and over 500 games of Catan in my life. The collection in the picture has been amassed through this time period but I will admit half of it comes from me hoarding these games during the pandemic. The newest addition is Evolution: Climat and the oldest game is probably the copy of Monopoly I inherited from my cousin. I own about 95% of the games pictured (2 or 3 belongs to friends) and have played &gt;80% of them at least once. We play about 60% of these games regularly. The other 40% isn't as popular mostly because they get too heavy for my group (i.e. Next War) and/or they're too aesthetic for me to part with (On Mars/ Clinic). 

There are some clear themes in my selection. GMT is one of my favorite publishers as I love my historical wargames. With a larger group of friends, though, I will say that Santa Monica, Pipeline, or just endless games of Catan is my favorite way to spend game day. Due to the pandemic, we have had trouble meeting and opening up some of the ones that we haven't played.

Some of the games that are difficult to see in the picture includes Citadel, Bears Vs. Babies, Welcome Back to the Dungeon, the entire Axis and Allies series (condensed into 3 boxes) and Unstable Unicorns. 

As mentioned, I'm quite the hoarder and have a couple of GMT P500 preordered that I cannot wait to get my hands on. I just need to find the shelf space.. or another shelf...

Also, I have sleeved all my cards using SleeveKings sleeves (60 micron thick) and they all fit perfectly. 

I did a thorough shake test and stored the box vertically and everything remained intact. You can see the lift on the box is barely a 2-3 mm or 1/4 inch at most.

Of the \~55 inserts I've printed for my games, this is easily my favorite.

Also, I want to mention that I love this game. It is so underrated. I've never played the other/older versions of Civilization board games but the Civ: A New Dawn with the Terra Incognita expansion definitely comes closer to the beloved Sid Meier's Civilization PC series. Even the base game is very good but the expansion elevates the game to the next level (great).

1034,boardgames,"It started 6 months ago when the second lockdown hit. Maybe it would be better if me, my friends/family would play more games together. I spend some money on simple board games that wouldn't scare anyone away. The fear kicked in, ""what if they dont like the first game, then they wouldn't want to try anything ever again"". So I decided to look further and bought some more games. One of these would stick I thought to myself.

I finally mustered up the courage to introduce the first game to my family. It was a succes and they wanted to play more. Now there had to be some more games with a bit more depth, becouse these simple games might get boring after a while. More games were bought, just in case. 

Then FOMO hit hard, I had to get the games in my native language. That would be easy to teach. Concordia went out of print, I really would have wanted that in my language. That could happen to other games on my list. Buy.

Board games don't go bad I convinced myself. These games I will definitly want to play somewhere in the future, doesn't matter if that will be in 20 years or more.

1050,boardgames,"I'll start by saying that I do enjoy Eldritch Horror and Mansions of Madness a lot. I bought every single expansion for those two titles even though some of them remain unplayed due to current obvious reasons.

When I got into the hobby finding stuff for Arkham Horror 2nd Edition was a bit too late and too expensive from where I live. I do own the original though, just never tried any of the expansions. I do enjoy it but found it to be too *sluggish* for my or my group's tastes. I've read that some expansions do solve some of the problems, but I think it's a bit too late for that.

Now that the third expansion for Arkham Horror 3rd Edition, I'm really perplexed whether I should give it a try. I know all about Arkham Horror: LCG, bought the core set, and Dunwich Legacy w/o Mythos Packs, but I'm somewhat reluctant on starting collecting it since, while it's a very engaging game, it's a huge investment if you want to collect at least the core cycles. Plus, it's also somewhat of a treasure hunt finding and buying older packs today.

So, my question is whether Arkham Horror 3rd Edition is an engaging game and different enough to be enjoyed by someone who doesn't consider himself an Arkham Files devotee even though I do own a lot of those games. Or should I embrace the fact, according to most reviews, that Arkham Horror: LCG is a much more worthy game?",Is Arkham Horror 3rd Edition worth checking out?

I know my shelf is less than optimal with the middle bar getting in the way, but it fits so perfectly in the only spot I have to store games. Now that my toddler has taken an interest in my games though, I'll need to figure out a new solution soon.

Most of my board gaming ends up being 2-players with my wife (especially these days), so I generally only buy games that work well with two people. I like to have some games for every occasion though (light to heavy games, party games, etc.). We enjoy heavy games, especially co-ops. Our favourites are probably Mage Knight, Spirit Island, and This War of Mine.

I just picked up Xia and the expansion after trying to get it for years, I've only had the chance to play solo so far but I'm loving it. I also finally found a copy of the Wow Board Game and Shadows of War expansion for a good price. I know it's not the best game, but I played it a lot in college with some friends, and I've really wanted to get it for the nostalgia and to try to get that group back together some day for a game.

* Princes of Florence: 3-player min, never hits the table
* All Creatures Big and Small: Good game, never really want to play anymore
* Thunderstone: Loved it years ago, but never play anymore

One was about racing dachshunds (wiener dogs). It came with these really colorful plastic dogs that you could add length to. The point was to win the race. 

The second game I have more of a vague memory of. It was these big plastic birds (maybe flamingos?) and they had a little trigger you could press to open and close their mouths. There were a lot of missing pieces but I remember having so much fun trying to bite each other with the birds.

1088,boardgames,"So about 10 years ago I played a game my area's public monthly board game meet up. I played this game that could serve a higher player count. Unfortunately since this was a fairly large meet up that happened I can't even recall who brought the game or who I played the game with. When I went back to college I remember it was simple enough that with some Pandemic pawns and a simulated board I could teach it to my friends...



Alright here's what I remember of this game:
- It played a really high player count, I wanna say 8-10 players
- I believe one player was secretly the spy or traitor or something to that effect
- Every player had a colored pawn on the board but on your turn you didn't need to move your pawn
- the board was a number of houses that looped around, they were numbered 1-10 except for the last house which was the evil house and maybe their was a bonus house that was good... But simple board with 11-12 large spaces
- On your turn I think you could move a pawn the number of spaces that was on the house they stood on...
- Maybe you were scoring points?
- it was an older game so in 2011 I remember thinking the copy I played looked like it was printed in the late 1980s
- The theme was these brightly colored houses that looked early 20th century 
- There might not have been a traitor... In fact I think everyone's color was secret and on your turn you moved any pawn you wanted and it would score the space it landed on...

 So the strategy was to get players to move your pawn to the high scoring spaces while moving other players pawns to the Blackened house

Any help on finding this game would be greatly appreciated!!!",Looking for help remembering a hidden role style game I played a long time ago...

1095,boardgames,"I had an idea for some Catan rules I'd like to bring to life and a felt this would be a good sub to ask for advice

So my friends and I were playing Settlers of Catan and we started talking about how rng heavy it was and how we could make it more strategic and less luck based. Somebody always seems to get screwed over by the dice and it leaves a salty taste in everyone's mouths afterwards. I had the idea of using dice with a different set of numbers so you could shift the probability in your favor when rolling. I feel this would remain fair because you wouldn't guarantee hitting a specific number and could accidentally end up hitting somebody else's wheat on 9 rather than your stone on 10. I found a good shifted distribution that keeps all numbers possible and leaves 7 as the most likely number for the robber's sake:

Low Roll: 1-1-1-2-4-6 with a standard d6

High Roll: 1-3-5-6-6-6 with a standard d6

The player could choose which set of dice they use before rolling each turn (or potentially pay for the rigged dice with a sheep so sheep actually find a use). I feel that this would offer more strategy around using lower and higher tiles, leaving fewer obsolete spaces and offering the player more choice in the game. As a bonus, if you use the high and low rigged dice together it gives you a 12 in 36 chance of rolling a 7, a 3 in 36 chance for each even number, and a 1 or 2 in 36 for the rest. I like to call it the ""anarchy set"" for those who are desperate to move the robber.

I'd love your guy's opinion on any potential game-play problems I'm being blind to (I do understand the anarchy set is a little out there) or any other changes ya'll know of to make the game less RNG based.

Also does anyone know where could I buy standard pip dice (preferably custom color) with customizable numbers on all sides? I'm having trouble finding anything that's not just ""stick you logo on the 1 face.""",I'm trying to re-balance Catan to be less RNG heavy and would like some opinions on my solution

tl;dr When the AI scheme card specifically directs a ""left side of the board action"" like recruit, pray, trade etc, does a worker get placed in that spot on the track? Or does a worker only get placed in that track when the AI is unable to take the ordered action (like Commission but the faith attribute is too low)?

I just fired up Paladins for a solo play through and I think I understand the AI flow. However, first round, the AI kept getting more and more workers. First action Kings Order (fortify), 2nd action pray (I know it doesn't get those workers back), 3rd action commission - took the recruit spot (which instant bonus was 2 workers), 3rd action garrison (which took a gain 1 worker spot), 4th action recruit (got a worker), 5th action commission (which it couldn't get so using the worker track it did pray), 6th action I got tired and cleaned it up, and it still had workers.

Please don't nitpick through and tell me where numbers are wrong bc I might be mixing up one or two actions. But my question is, did the AI just get very lucky in the order of its scheme cards and I should expect this sort of thing? Or, when I got that first ""pray"" scheme card, should I have put a worker in the 'pray' spot on the top left of the AI board? (Thus disabling the AI from getting a 2nd pray action during the round)

He was polite and offered me the use of his deck and went with a basic un-modified deck instead, giving himself a handicap of an extra coin to start the game with.  They had already completed the campaign and this is in the post-game scenario with their now permanent changes.

It seems a common trope to have women in poses to show off their curves while fighting bad guys (obviously the best time to try to please some men.)

What can you all think of?

A few fantasy games I can think of are:

\- One Deck Dungeon

\- Too Many Bones

\- Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle Earth (There are lots of cards, so I could be misremembering)

\- Gloomhaven? (I would like to discuss this a bit more I think. I haven't seen all the art, but I remember Childres made a point of changing the art to make women have practical armor.

I took my first hit in January of 2018, with **Ca$h 'n Gun$**. It was recommended by a friend who had passed, and I bought it as a way to remember him. It turned out to be a hit with my game group, but it didn't really spark the ""I need more games"" urge in me. That came a year later when I bought **Lords of Waterdeep**. I had never even heard of ""worker placement"", didn't know what ""Euro"" even meant vis-à-vis a board game, and was confused to find out that a board game had an expansion. 

Since buying LoW, I uh... I kinda got silly with it. I found out that I really like playing new board games. I can't think of which game would be my favorite to play because I enjoy all of them, but the deluxe version of **Bass: Birmingham** is probably my favorite game to *have*. The art is gorgeous, the clay chips are more fun to play with than the cardboard money tokens, and I don't know what it is about black chipboard but *I love it*. Marvel Villainous is probably my least favorite of the bunch. I bought it for my son because he loves Marvel stuff, but I never much cared for the original and the Marvel version didn't change that. 

Here's a list of the games I have in the pipe on KS -

* **Wonderland's War**

* **Steampunk Rally Fusion**

* **Dodos Riding Dinos**

* **Tiny Epic Pirates**

* **Terraforming Mars Big Box**

1173,boardgames,"This is my first board game outside of the classics such as monopoly and battleships and all those older games. I've found that if you go first in Dark Edition... you seem to have a huge advantage? This might be the case for all different versions of the game that I haven't played but from what I'm seeing if you go first and start in Tokyo in the 2 player rule set, its very hard to be forced out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Staying in Tokyo has a huge advantage with getting a head start on energy pooling while the other player is trying to roll smashes in an attempt to force a yield before they get too far ahead. Meanwhile, the person in Tokyo that's farming energy can roll for their wickedness / victory points as the other person is trying to roll attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I played a game where I was unable to enter Tokyo even once due to the other person getting ahead, healing from cards and doing double damage to me. I had to focus on staying alive and at this point it wasn't an option to even try getting them to yield. I played defensively, passively getting victory points with the herbivore card as I knew there was no moving that rock of a player but ultimately died to an attack that did 7 damage. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried looking for information about this but there seemed to be no one talking about it which makes me wonder if we're just not playing it right.

1174,boardgames,"I'm looking to set up an after school board game club at the secondary school (Ages 11-18) I will be working at. I'm just wanting to field your suggestions on what games would be good for it.

To help, below I've got some general criteria of games I'm looking for

●Playtime: around 40 minutes to an hour, no longer than 1hr 30 minutes
 ○Even though I'm passionate about the job I do want to ensure myself and students get home at a reasonable time
 ●Considering splitting games into 3 categories based on length and complexity 
   ○Class A: Big games, for students to play they must arrive on time and start setting up quickly
     ●EXAMPLE: Terraforming Mars
   ○Class B: Medium games, still a good experience length good for students who are late or played some Class C games waiting for others
    ●EXAMPLE: Ticket to ride
   ○Class C: Sweet and simple games, can usually go for a couple of replays
    ●EXAMPLE: Coup, Skull
 ○This time should also include time to introduce new players to the game

●Complexity: Being Secondary school, I can not imagine many people being board game hobbyists so games so big complex games with many moving parts may not be appropriate 
 ○Games should be able to be easily explained by the more frequent members of the club
   ●EXAMPLE: Robo Rally, Tsuro 

●Learning element: Being a maths teacher, I can recognise the maths in play with most games and most games have learning elements embedded in theme so games that are good learning tools as well would be helpful
 ○In terms of learning through themeing, the theme itself has to be appropriate. But even better if the theme can include some light role play
  ●EXAMPLE: Pandemic
 ○For learning through mechanics, this can involve any subject not just maths. The example i have is maths based mechanics as it gets students comfortable with using compass directions and construction
   ●EXAMPLE: TREASURE ISLAND

●Social element: Hopefully through this club I can develop student relationships across years and I think this would be best done with games that engage in social interaction, imagination and variety.
 ○Social interactions that can be positive like working as a team or having people word out ideas and discussion
  ●EXAMPLE: Resistance Avalon
 ○Imagination and creativity are also important so games that promote that would be great
  ●EXAMPLE: Dixit
○Variety, I like games that have that one oddball element that allows the game to be more tangible whether it is special dice or restrictions on types of communication
  ●EXAMPLE: Escape, Curse of the temple

●Finally, have to be games are sustainable. As in if I lose a piece or the card gets bent out of shape would that make the game unplayable. Would the cost to replace be negible or would I need to get a whole new copy. Prefer to keep budget sensible. I understand print and plays maybe a good shout

We also recently played Hexplore It: Valley of the Dead King, which involved powering up loads of character stats with 20+ characters to pick from. It's a fun game, but the rules are messy.  
  
Gloomhaven is an example of something with a fun power curve that takes wayyy too long to get into. It takes weeks of sessions to level your character up to 5+, so I'm looking for something that can be done in a single session.

1187,boardgames,"In the photo, there is one of the oldest games - Mehen. “Egyptian snake game.” 🐍 played between roughly 3100 B.C. and 2300 B.C. A typical Mehen board in the form of the coiled snake came with 3 lion pieces🦁, 3 lionesses, and 6 sets of colored marbles. Archeologists believe that the marbles and the lions were playing pieces and the game was for up to 6 players. 

The rules of Mehen remain unclear, but a game called 'The Hyena Game'🐺 was found being played on a Mehen-type board in Sudan in 1921. 

This is a game for several players. Each player tries to get their main piece to the center and back whereupon their 'hyena' piece is released. The Hyena piece then also travels to the center and back but can terrorize and eat the other player's main pieces on the way. The most modern reconstructions of the Mehen game have used the rules of the Hyena Game as their basis.

What do you think could be the real rules of Mehen? Can you think of any other modern game that has something in common with Mehen?

1188,boardgames,"One of the reasons I like board games so much is that they offer up a pretty consistent stream of 'aha' moments, where something suddenly comes into focus or a certain mechanic clicks for the first time. 

I've been playing My City, and I'm so impressed by how Knizia modifies a few simple rules and it completely changes your strategy. It's probably one of my favorite things in the hobby to see a robust design get tweaked in lots of different ways. The Arkham Horror LCG does it better than any game I've ever seen, and with amazing thematic effect - just to name one example, the Essex County Express, where&gt;! you're racing to get to the front of a collapsing train!&lt;. Pandemic Legacy S1 (the only one I've played, tho I have Season 0 waiting) was great at this too. Surprisingly, the latest Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective set, the Baker Street Irregulars, has been bending its system in extremely clever ways. &gt;!(We just played the third scenario where you have to frantically track down the file and run all over - and possibly leave! - London)!&lt;

The Exit games are all wonderful in this category too - I keep wondering when they're going to run out of ideas but every game manages to surprise me with something unexpected.

1189,boardgames,"So first things first, I'm not a seasoned TTG player by any stretch. I love creative games, and I love strategy (Portal Board Game, anyone?). However, my friends and I all gravitate to one game every time (and yes, we have not yet played Ticket to Ride, so our mainstay may well change).    
    
Basically, I love Monopoly, but eventually everyone gets set in their go-to ""strategy"" and changing things up gets harder to do. So what if color sets weren't all next to each other and Boardwalk and North Carolina weren't always on the same side of the board? I thought about doing a custom square board where every space was printed onto a removable placard that could be placed into a recess on the board, so every game could play differently. I.e., the board itself would be blank, and the normal spaces would be separate pieces that could be placed onto the board in whatever order you like before starting a game.    
    
I came very close to making that, but after discussing it with the boys, I decided to make a Monopoly ""board"" that isn't restricted to the linear, predictable path of the normal square board. I think the general consensus is that much of Monopoly's outcome is defined by the lack of player choice. Players don't have to do much to win. Strategy is sort of an afterthought.    
    
So I created this prototype (https://imgur.com/Xlq8mFv) for a fully modular board. You can have alternate routes. You can have color sets on different sides of the board.    
    
Things to note:    

* When playtesting it, we found that having TOO many options of how to travel across the board means it's incredibly easy to not land on other players' property. This removes incentive to play.    
* It's incredibly easy to buy up all property very quickly in this particular configuration.    
* Defining route of travel is difficult. I DID make little arrows to be placed on spaces to indicate direction of travel but did not employ them in this initial playtest. For the interim, we decided the rule was that you couldn't travel back onto the space you just came from (but you can still travel backwards by going a different route around that space).    
* I think the original Monopoly benefits from its linearity in that it forces players to fall victim to the whims of happenstance.    
* Rules need to be established for how to properly set up the board.    
* There are 2 extra Community Chest and Chance spaces in case they are needed to bridge sections of board.    
* I created new spaces that I'm just calling ""path spaces"" for now. They have different footprints on them (pawprints, tire tracks, etc) and are used to connect parts of the board but do not count as ""spaces,"" in that they don't use up a number on your dice roll.    
* I think more reward and penalty spaces are needed to incentivize travel.    
* I think a rule must be established that only a single entry and exit for the ""GO"" space may exist.    
    
It played a bit poorly and we only did one playthrough and it was very quick and very uninteresting. Gonna tweak things. Some other general info, I spent a combined 5 hours in photoshop making all of the spaces in Photoshop. I spent a combined 5 hours cutting out the original prototype with an X-acto, and another 10-ish hours cutting out the printed pieces and the bits of posterboard that they're adhered to. They are sat on a white corkboard poster with plexiglass on top. Only the board is custom.

I get that it's a business decision on their part, and I really don't blame them, but this realistically was the only big box Kickstarter I was going to do this year, so it's still really disappointing. I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet (get base Nemesis now, wait until retail, etc.), so I'm not looking to piggyback right this minute, but just wanted to express my frustration, especially considering I've been waiting \~6 months for the pledge manager to open back up.

1198,boardgames,,BURNINATING THE COUNTRYSIDE!!! So excited this arrived today.
1199,boardgames,"This post is inspired by a game of Spirit Island that happened today, which I’ll share later. But sometimes you are playing a game you expect to take a while but that miracle combo comes up and you get a crushing, decisive victory early. Sometimes so early the table just sits shocked until someone goes “we’ll do we play again?” I want to hear these stories! What was the game and what crazy combo caused it to be so quick?

 Ok so here’s mine from today. Spirit Island, Normally that game takes 1.5- 2 hours for us to play, especially since we just got the Jagged Earth so are still learning the new stuff. I’m playing Fractured Days for the first time, which is a time based spirit that gets the unique ability to foresee card options and choose from them rather than always pulling more randomly. 

During setup, I see one of my major power cards is an insanely powerful option. 8 energy to suck 1 of almost everything into the target land, deal 15 damage, and destroy a bunch of beneficial stuff, and you can permanently lose access to powers to repeat it. So turn 1 I hoard as much energy as I can l, grab that card, and instruct my wife to pick off the two explorers that are out of range. 

Beginning of turn 2 hoard energy again, place a presence so I was in the middle of both boards, play the major power as a swift thanks to my wife, and create two black holes that suck in everything but 1 explorer and wipes the board 99% clean. Then my wife picks off the last explorer.

So that was a turn 2, swift phase, terror level 1 win in just a couple minutes.",Share your fastest surprise wins

I remember following the ""living rules"" last summer after the release, and a bunch of the errata due to poor QA on the board and the cards, and I'm glad GMT sent it out for free because it was going to be a huge pain to print out the stickers for the board myself and try to remember certain things about cards.

1259,boardgames,"Just wanted to start a discussion and ask opinions!

So, I buy games both ways - I back KS campaigns and I buy games the normal way.  But I'm curious about the effects of both on sales of the game.

When I buy a game, one of the BIGGEST factors for me is how easy it is to get the *whole* game.  Including bonus content in a Kickstarter is dope, but if I'm buying a game that came out a few years ago, and everyone talks about how good such-and-such KS exclusive was, then I'm probably not going to buy the game at all if I can't find that exclusive somewhere.

(Note: I'm only talking about discrete mechanical elements here.  Any purely aesthetic stuff is nice to have, but won't be a barrier for me to get into the game if I can't find it.  KS-exclusive art or minis or whatever.)

So what I'm wondering is: am I alone?  Like, KS is a great way to get the game initially funded, but do you hurt your long-term sales potential by locking latecomers out of wanting your game?

For example: Eclipse: Second Dawn looks like an *ideal* game for me, and I'm happy to pay $150 for it.  But since I won't be able to get all that cool extra content, I'll always feel like I'm playing an incomplete game.  So I won't even go for it.

The same is true to a certain extent of games with a bonkers amount of expansions already in existence.  I almost didn't get Anachrony for that reason, but they're awesome enough to have a single item that's the base game and all the expansion content.  In general, I'm happy to buy such items!

But if I find great games that are ten years old but are ""complete in the box,"" I just find it so so easy to grab them.

So what are everyone's thoughts?  Does the way KS campaigns work create a buying frenzy in the beginning at the expense of long-term sales/interest?  Or am I in such a minority with my buying habits that I'm not representative?  Would love to hear your views! (And especially if you've been on the other side and have sales anecdotes to share!)","Kickstarter Versus Retail: Barriers to Entry, FOMO, and Long-term Sales?"

So why am I writing about this? Apparently my significant other, the magnificent Instragram boardgamer [@CatsAndMeeples](https://www.instagram.com/catsandmeeples/) had this game sent to her for preview and feedback - but she is no wargamer!

The standard go to for my group is either;

1. Uno - everyone knows how to play it, there is enough screw over someone else to keep it going, we play speed uno too so you have to pay pretty close attention and have good reflexes, it's a good game to get some laughs out of when someone get's stuck with a stack of draw 2's.
2. Sorry - everyone knows how to play, but usually most people end the game angry that they got screwed over so many times or never got any 1's or 2's to even get started.
3. Clue - good guessing game, makes some people a little over confident, and some people are just too good at the deduction, still a nice simple game as long as everyone can agree on the actual rules and not the house rules (One cannot just walk out of and back into the same room, or choose to stay in the room)
4. rummikub - nothing better than rearranging the board for 30 minutes just to be left with 1 tile that doesn't fit anywhere and having to put the whole thing back again.
5. Yahtzee - it's just so easy to travel with this, specially when you can get
6. Euchre - My girlfriends family lives by this game, and I am not exaggerating that statement.

Then there are the games that are just too boring to even bother with, but I still keep them;

1. boggle - I am bad with words and just find it to be a bit of a drag
2. Game of Life - the pure luck of the game makes it very boring in my eyes, I used to LOVE this game, because my ADD self didn't have to pay attention, just spin the dial and move my merry little self along the path.
3. Go for broke - when over half the spaces are blank, you can go a long time without doing anything, roll the dice, move your piece, next person, repeat.  I have actually thought about making my own version of this because I find the concept clever.

Some we get out just for special occasions;

1. gayopoly - just because it's fun, though if I get stuck in the closet, I am for ever there because I don't know ANY of the songs to get back out.  So this usually just sits as a proud back drop on my shelves, that many new comers comment on.

The one's I need to teach my girlfriend so we can play together;

1. backgammon - grew up playing this with my dad a lot and always enjoyed the simplicity but yet the pretty deep strategy involved

Anyway, so the premise is each player is a trawl fishing company that has to manage it's money to buy fishing boats, dock space, and warehouses. 

Each round the players simultaneously choose where each boat they own will go that round: 

1. Stay in the dock (doing nothing but not costing no upkeep/repairing) 

2. Fishing shallow waters (this is safe but produces low fish) 

3. Fishing deep waters (more likely to get the boat damaged but possibly produces large amounts of fish) 

Perhaps also before fishing commences players can bribe each other to not fish and such because another mechanic is fish population. Where the more the players fish, the lower the population gets and the harder for it to regenerate gets and eventually if they over-fish, there are no fish left.. Or something like that, perhaps there are penalties for this. 

Also I was thinking that perhaps players could pay to sabotage other companies or something?

His combo of unique mechanics+incredible production+original themes really hits that sweet spot for me.

I'd love to hear any thoughts, but here are some specific questions:

\- How do his games work across the spectrum of gamers? 

\- How does a game play at 2p and at 4p (my most frequent player counts)? 

\- How replayable are they? 

\- What other games do you like/dislike? (I was relatively lukewarm on Scythe, another game I hesitated to play for years as something that I thought was for a different type of gamer than me.)

\- Did you have any issues with Root that were improved by any of its expansions, especially the Clockwork one?

1381,boardgames,"I've been playing modern board games for some time now but I've only recently started to consciously think about this aspect of the games I play. I think playing [Marrakech](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29223/marrakech/images) repeatedly on Board Game Arena is what really opened my eyes to it. Perhaps I should explain...

So Marrakech is a game that has a very clear random element to the game: it has a roll-and-move mechanism, where the dice dictates whether you move the common salesperson token one (⅙), two (⅓), three (⅓) or four (⅙) spaces around the board before laying a rug next to where it lands. The game is about working around this random element by playing the odds: you have to weigh up the likelihood of landing on your opponents' rugs―forcing you to pay them coins equal to the contiguous area their rugs of the colour landed on covers―against the ability to further extend your own rugs, cover over theirs and the better board position it will afford you with the salesperson: forcing your opponent into your covered areas.

The game works fantastically well in a one-versus-one scenario and it is one of my favourite abstract, two-player games. However in higher player counts I find the game breaks down: too much changes between your turns and it becomes too difficult to make any truly meaningful moves. I.e. the 'entropy' of the game increases with the player count and there is nothing in the game to deal with this.

Now I imagine this is true of most games, regardless of whether there is a clear random element or not: if you have more players doing stuff in a game then, naturally, more stuff is going to change between your turns. But many games manage this by making the turns microscopic or by putting a lot of the action on your own player board where it does not have any impact on the other players.

But there are a lot of games where the action takes place on a central board: Food Chain Magnate and Brass, for example, address this by growing/shrinking the play area so that the actions are spread out over a larger area reducing the 'entropy' in the 'system' as a fraction of the whole. But there are also many games, like Marrakech and Santorini, that don't address this situation at all, and just let the game play differently at different player counts, to the point where they're practically different games.

So I'm interested to know:

* Are there any other games you can think of that deal with this problem, not by growing the play area but in other, clever ways?
* Does it bother anyone else when a game doesn't deal with player count entropy differences?
* Should designers be more aware of this problem and take better steps to deal with it? Is it lazy to just let the games play differently at different player counts?",Entropy differences at different player counts

1384,boardgames,"Being a part of the BGG Facebook group and Boardgame Reddit, makes it look like people from North America have a strong preference for AmeriGames, and Europeans for Eurogames.  
You might read this and think ""Well duh, it's in the name"", but I was expecting it to be a bit of a mix. It's 2021, by now it could have easily mingled. My dive into boardgames began with an AmeriGame, but by now the bigger part of my collection is Eurogames (and I'm Dutch). 

Is this average preference for a type of game really embedded in the culture of the continent? Or is it possible that neither groups have given the other option a fair try? Or something else?

1385,boardgames,"Since Despicable Plots expand-alone release a few days ago I’ve gotten back into the Villainous hype train, to the point where I want to make a whole custom character for the fun.

The Villain: Many think Te Kā is the obvious choice but not only is she really just and angry form of Te Feti, but does not at all fit villain vibe like Tamatoa does. Sure, he’s only in the movie for one song, but you could argue the same for the red queen as she shows up in the original Alice in wonderland in a couple scene max so I think it’s not too much of a stretch. Plus there a cult following (for good reason) so this villain would have a lot more people open their wallets.

The Objective: This is for sure the one I need help with. My best idea is for him to have somehow collected enough items to be SHINY. But right now I can only think of two in Moana, Maui’s Hook and of course the heart of Te Feti. This kind of objective however seems quite similar to Ursula’s objective to start your turn with Trident and crown in her lair. I want to add so uniqueness. If you have any better ideas I’d love to hear them but this type of objective aligns perfectly with his goal to just be SHINY.
Perhaps to make it different enough from Ursula He needs to have some extra steps. What’s awkward is I feel like Maui and Moana should be defeated to retrieve these artifacts which is AGAIN similar to Ursula having to beat King Triton. Maybe the unique part is that he has to defeat both.

1386,boardgames,"Introduction:  
So as a hobby I like to world build and for a race, I have in one of my worlds, I created a board game. The rules lead to an extremely open-ended game that seems simple. I wrote a program to play the game using minimax and it can beat me fairly easily, although, this is typically because I blunder. In having this play against itself so many strange non-intuitive moves happen, a lot of them make sense to me but only on a surface level.  
Problem:  
How can I analyze a board game of this complexity in a way that will allow me to better understand what moves should be made and why? I'd essentially like to generalize how the game is played to some extent and give meaning to some of the moves. I have no idea where to even begin in building a thorough understanding though. Part of me worries that it might just be too complex, but I can follow it at times so I'm not so sure. Any idea's on how I might approach this problem?",How to Understand a Made-Up Complex Board Game

1390,boardgames,"I purchased Patchwork for me and my girlfriend to play a couple of months ago. She is not into super thinky games so it seemed like something simple she would enjoy. 

The first two games we played, we did horrible. We both scored negative points. However, we were really enjoying the game. 

I then sat back and wondered how I could do better at the game. I decided that I would try to determine a 'net value' for each of the three available tiles I could purchase. 

I realized that every space moved on the time board could essentially be considered a loss of one button, since each space could have been used as income instead of time to patch the quilt. So if a peice would take 3 time board movements to put on my board, then I would count that as -3 buttons on the net cost. Next, I would multiply the income value of each button by the remaining income spaces I had left to cross on the time board. So if a peice had two buttons on it and I still had to cross 4 income spaces, that would be +8 to the net value of buying that peice. Next I would consider that each square that makes up the peice is preventing -2 points at the end of the game, so I would multiply the number of squares by 2, so if a peice was 4 squares in size then that is +8 in value. Next, the most obvious, I would factor in the cost of the actual price in buttons. So if the cost is 3 buttons, that is -3 buttons on the net value. I would sum these values, in this example we would have -3 + 8 + 8 + -3 = 10 button net value. I would do this for all three peices available to me and purchase the one with the greatest net value. This was incredibly tedious, but it worked. 

My score at the end of this game was around 58. This wasn't fun to play at all though. 

The point of this post is to ask others if you've had an issue like this, where you wish the game didn't essentially boil down to simple arithmetic? If so, did you figure out a solution to this, or do you have a list of games that you've had this issue with that you'd recommend I should avoid? This is really directed at simple 2-4 player games, as I prefer open-information games for solo play or when playing with highly-experienced players.",Has anyone else experienced this issue while playing perfectly open-information games that you were hoping would be simple and relaxing?

8,Fallout,"Hey there folks! As the same suggests, i have a hypothetical faction i have for a ""fallout: rhode island"" esque thing (its for a dnd campaign set in my state) and i wanna run it down to see if it makes, well good sense! Ok, here we go:


Located underneath williams University (irl brown university), vault tec decided to place one of there famous experimental vaults on campus, vault 31. This vaults main experiment was that relating to how a society would form, if that society only truly had 1 piece of material to both read and listen to: the writings of one howards p lovecraft (wouldnt be him exactly, but u get what I mean). Of course the inhabitants of this vault wouldnt fully believe this at first, wanting to have other things to read and listen, that was until a small following began to form: the cult of the sleeper

The cult of the sleeper was started when one of the members of the vault, One Norman smalls began reading the texts from inside the vault after a breakdown of sorts. Once he began reading, however, he began to look at this material not as just some weird, scifi story/world to look at, but as a thing to bring salvation to these people. After awhile, Normal created a tomb of sorts from material, and dubbed it ""the sleepers tome"", after a apocalyptic deity in these novels lore commonly referred to as the sleeper

After indoctrinating those he could (and murdering the others), norman finally had his flock. After ""consulting"" with the sleeper, Norman believed that his children needed more than just a small hole in the ground, and that they needed to spread there religion to all. So, about 19 years after the bombs fell, the cult leaped into the flooded and eradiated wastelands known as the promised lands (nickname for the wasteland in ri)

They took control (well, mostly) of williams university, and created a community, forming a settlement the locals call innsmouth. This is now where our lovely protagonist (or, protagonists in my case) meet them.. only after theyve become topside for over 73 years

Innsmouth still stands, acting as the cults main base, but there leaders changed nowadays, ever since father norman died due to a sworm of ""locusts"" (bloodbugs/radflies). Now the church is lead by sister Mindis, a sadistic and warmongering leader, whom is hoping tk change the church to become a true fighting and conjuring machine against the other factions of providence, including that of slaters slavers, the Coelition and the mob (canon that the triggermen truly came from this area)

This was probably done to make reload animations simplified, however, with my new knowledge on the AR platform, I find myself bothered by the fact the Service Rifle and others still retain their forward assist (which is used in the animation when condition of the rifle is low). However in reality, a side charging upper has no need for a forward assist, as its bolt is constructed in a different manner (see  [(23) Side Charging Upper: Guide, Tips, Maintenance, and More Common Questions - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3zsQkhFHfI) ) 

This is probably something a vast majority of y'all don't really care all that much about; it's just the more I've learned about real life firearm mechanics, the less Fallout firearms make sense realistically (take the 10mm pistol from Fallout 1 &amp; 2, as it's a semi auto revolver with a detectable magazine, or the Combat Shotgun of Fallout 3 and its ejection port located like 6-8in behind the magazine). 

TL;DR: FNV Service Rifle and other Fallout Firearms have unnecessary parts and non-operable designs, making it confusing for an amateur gunsmith who's played the Fallout series of years. But that doesn't mean they aren't cool and iconic.",FNV Service Rifle Qualm of Mine; a.k.a. How I Found Out the Firearms of Fallout Don't Make Sense

23,Fallout,"Bear with me here,

Although many might feel a strong sense of betrayal in that last talking head sequence with Jacoren for being essentially permanently exiled from the only home we ever had, it's necessary to understand that he did it because he not only deeply cares about Vault 13 but also you.

Throughout the game, we can see how Jacoren cares about your well-being out in the wastes and appreciates the work you've done to preserve the continuity of the vault.

A few examples:

&gt;*""You have no idea how* ***sorry*** *I am to send you back out.""* `-When sending you out to the wastes again.`  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Don't downplay what you've done. You've saved a lot of lives.""* `-After you find the Water Chip.`  
&gt;  
&gt;*""You should be* ***proud of yourself*** *for all you've accomplished. We depended on you and you came through.""* `-After ending the mutant threat`

However, Jacoren must also wrestle with the risk of the vault residents wanting to leave. As he says in his ending speech, were you to re-enter the vault, many would see the greatness that you've accomplished as proof that the outside world is worth exploring. But we know better, the world in 2161 is a world that has barely recovered from the devastation less than a century ago, a world where savagery is widespread and only the most vicious survive.

&gt;""*Everyone will want to talk to you. Every youngster will look up to you, and want to* ***emulate*** *you. And then what?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*They'll want to leave. What happens to the Vault if we lose the best of a generation? What if we are the only safe place in the world? You just gave us back all these lives . . . I can't take the chance of losing them.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I've made a lot of* ***tough decisions*** *since I took this position. But* ***none of them harder than this one.*** *You saved us, but you'll kill us. I'm sorry. You're a hero . . .* ***and you have to leave****.""* `-Ending speech`

It's a dangerous prospect for Jacoren, but it pains him greatly to have to exile you. He is eternally grateful for what you have done and could never repay you, but for you to re-enter the vault would only cause the destruction of what you've accomplished.

Depending on the character you roleplay, you may either simply leave, or end up brutally murdering him, which I believe is morally wrong. While the canonical ending has Jacoren live, we can see how opening the vault leads to its demise when in Fallout 2, we see residents massacred and ransacked by the Enclave, the danger of the outside world Jacoren warned us about.

What do you guys think? I'd love to hear what your opinions are on the matter.",Why Jacoren was right to exile the Vault Dweller

43,Fallout," Story Time:

Last night I launched my first nuke. By myself too. And I was *not prepared*.

So my goal with FO76 was to finish the MSQ, hit 50 and launch my own Nuke. Last night I got to the ""*I Am Become Death*"" quest and began my quest to unleash nuclear hellfire. Got my Keycard. Looked up the code for this week because I'm not stupid (and also a bit lazy).

I figure that since you have to chase down the keycard and figure out the code that the actual Silo Dungeon won't be too long or hard, right?

I load up with my PA. Take my Minigun with 1,300 rounds of 5mm, and my Gatling Plasma with 1,500 rounds. 15 Frags. And a crap ton of healing and food. I feel like that is gonna be more than enough, right? Maybe a couple wave defenses, a couple of Sentry Bots at the end and that is all, right?

......

...........

I get about 2 fifths of the way or so through the silo and I'm dry. Dead Man's Click on both guns. Now, being an intelligent, veteran gamer, I have some options one of which is;

1. Retreat, restock with a CRAPTON more ammo and come back better prepared.
2. Ask for help since I have a keycard, know the code and people like loot, right?

Either one of those would be a good option, right? Which do you think I picked?

If you chose

3. Put up my dukes, yell ""**WHY DON'T YOU COME CATCH THESE HANDS INSTEAD, BROBOT!?""** and start punching the nearest robot in it's face

Congratulations, you're correct also what the hell were you doing in my house watching me last night?

Needless to say, that didn't really produce results - or any progress really. Especially since I had zero Unarmed Perks. Sometime after like the 12th punch I remembered I had grenades, and those got me a little further, but not by much (GODDAMN Grenades have terrible range in FO76).

At this point, I gave up right?

Nope. After the grenade attempts, I realized I had picked up an *Assaultron Blade* somewhere along my way to the Silo. I was no longer merely an ape trying to smash my way through technology.

***I was an ape with a SHARP STICK.***

So I did the only logical thing - I did a metric FUCKLOAD of chems, put on my only two Melee Perks (Incisor 1 and Master Gladiator 1) and threw myself into the melee.

The Blade was about as effective as a rusty machete IRL, but it cut body parts off surprisingly well and often. Screamingly (somewhat quietly though) like Rambo half the time, I managed to cut down even THE SENTRY BOT before I finally arrived at my salvation - the Tinkerer's Bench meant to be used for the Mainframe Cores. I crafted an *excessive* amount of Plasma Cores and blasted my way through the rest of the dungeon. After finally launching the nuke nearly *an hour past* when I thought I was going to stop playing, I emerged from the silo covered in blood (mine) and and soaked in oil (mostly theirs).

Also, my CAMP was a bit too close the Prime Fissure, so I had wound up nuking my own CAMP to boot. Which I got to watch! (And die in!). After dying to the nuke....it respawned me underground. INSIDE THE FISSURE.

I had to get out of my PA in order to die again, so that I would respawn above ground.

Only to die from Rads immediately again.

Finally I spawned at the CAMP, lived long enough get into my Shelter (still standing) and get back into my PA to join the fight and finish my time with FO76.

In conclusion - I just wanted you to know the story behind that Troubleshooter's Wood Right Arm you got and immediately vendor'd last night.","FO76: I launched my first nuke about 10PM EST last night, I just want you to know that was a grueling, arduous task for me"

50,Fallout,"After 15 years (thousands of hours) of playing various titles from the Fallout series, it has obviously made me ponder about what it would be like if the post-great war were reality. And now I seriously question my morals; not necessarily in real life but if I was living in the wasteland and here is why:

Naturally I have an almost unhealthy obsession with the apocalypse and various survival skills. This did not spawn from my love of Fallout (it only made my obsession even more enjoyable), it spawned from how much of a “prepper” and conspiracy theorist my dad was for the longest time. 
         My earliest memory of this was when my dad had my family hunker down on his ranch during the Y2K scare. He seriously thought that nuclear war was going to start at 12am on January 1st 2000 and the entire world was going to go to hell. He had stockpiles of survival and emergency equipment... and I mean STOCKPILES of equipment (seriously pallets stacked in almost every room separated into categories). He had us all stay inside with all the windows boarded up for two days. I love my dad but he’s absolutely an insane. He has many patented inventions and such in the United States, so he’s also kind of a genius as well.
        As I got older he taught me how to shoot, defend myself in close combat, expedition survival skills/foraging, how to hunt (with both a bow and various pistols/rifles) and weapons Manufacturing (both melee and ballistic). There were a few incidents where he got into fights or shoot outs with people because of his temper and ties with certain factions (which I can’t talk about publicly unfortunately).
      Anyways aside from all of that, I believe that’s where I officially start to talk about why my Karma would probably be considered bad in a real life Fallout:
         
MURDER:
My dad contributed to my apathy and lack of certain emotional attributes a normal person would have. I believe this came from him beating the hell out of me a few times, and different kinds of abuse from one of his ex-girlfriends (at least that’s what the therapists have said). This is why I wouldn’t have a problem being a bounty hunter and contract killer in the wasteland. If I don’t know them, their life truly is meaningless to me; If I’m getting paid a good sum of bottle caps that is and I’m not cheap. Also, I’d kill anyone who gets in the way of my quests in the real wasteland, or anyone who threatens or harms me.
    Though if you’re on my side or associated with me, I  love you and you’re family. I don’t lack the ability to love or lack any sympathy.

STEALING AND PICKPOCKETING:
Finders keepers. If you want your stuff safe and secure, pay attention to it. If your irresponsibility of watching your valuables gets in the way or you are not setting up proper security to protect it, I’ll consider it mine.
   When I was in high school I stole from locked lockers (padlocks and key locks) and from peoples coats/pockets in the hallway during passing periods as a game. And even still I don’t feel bad about it. (I was also obsessed with the Thieves guild from The Elder Scrolls)

SLAVERY:
In real life I do not condone or support any type of slavery or unwanted physical acts whatsoever. I have actually stopped a few situations from happening to friends of mine IRL that could have gone horribly wrong.
In the wasteland though, slavery is technically not uncommon or illegal. There are no laws (besides in certain locations controlled by certain factions). Therefore, I would not try and stop anyone from owning slaves or free any slaves (unless under certain circumstances) and that alone would consider me either Neutral or Bad Karma on that subject.

FACTIONS:
In real life, nobody controls me or tells me what to do. Nobody. I don’t support our current government or any type of enforcement because socially, we are already in this alone and at a free-for-all. In the wasteland, don’t try to annex me or enslave me or even force me to join anything. That WILL NOT go over well to you unless there are IMMENSE benefits.

RAIDING:
Now, I’ll never raid a house that has a family with children or the house is entirely women (I have so much respect for women), but I will raid a house of capable and non-sickly men. Murder of “innocents” is bad karma naturally.

CANNIBALISM:
I don’t see a problem with eating your neighbor who had a negative impact on you, a rando who raided or caused you harm or one of your group who passed away. The wasteland’s food supply is scarce by the time New Vegas and Fallout 4 came around; there is even a risk of famine. I say get all the food you can, even if it’s name was Bob at some point.

AND FINALLY, SPEECH:
If it benefits me, even if it possibly negatively impacts someone in the wasteland, I will use my charisma and natural wordplay (IRL speech skill) to manipulate them. As long as I’m making caps or making something happen. BOTTLE CAPS Y’ALL. WHOOP WHOOP.

So in conclusion I would probably be close to something as the Wasteland’s Satan. Lol. Or maybe you guys think I deserve a lighter Karma sentence?",I would have the WORST KARMA if Fallout was real life and here’s why:

52,Fallout,"Hey all, I had a pretty good shower thought the other day. What if the next fallout game took place in the Midwest, and what if the Enclave were a faction. Basically, this midwestern Enclave would be drastically different than the Enclave from previous games. This Enclave is the remnants of the Enclave that were defeated in the previous games, who migrated east after their defeat. This Enclave had to survive by trading with the local survivors and after a decade the Enclave remnants became a formidable force once again, but the years of trade and mutual assistance between the survivors has caused a rift between the Enclave remnants, and caused two major factions to arise. (OWB-fallout mod influence incoming) The Purists, and the \[insert other faction name here\] these two factions are separated along the lines of how to treat the survivors. The purists wish to remain true to the old Enclave ways and purge anything mutated. While the other faction still wants to remove radiation, they wish to find a non-lethal way of doing so, they also wish to cleanse the previous sins the Enclave has committed. The player character gets to decide which faction wins the civil war that ensues. Regardless of what faction you choose, you can get optional settlement missions which will either purge/restore (based on the faction you chose) the map. Eventually if you do enough of these missions you can completely remove radiation from the map, basically turning this fallout game into DayZ looking world. As to not completely remove the challenge of the irradiated creatures, the NPC's become much more difficult and a few of the irradiated creatures survive the cleansing which only make them much stronger. The player character is also able to have a number of Enclave soldiers at his side of which they are the commander of. Of course this is not the only faction you can side with this is just one of many that would be in this fallout game, so you could still keep the irradiated world. Anyway these are just my shower thoughts regarding fallout, thanks for reading!",Idea for next fallout game regarding the Enclave.

railroad: the railroad would probably still break into the institute but what they'd do is help plan a mass escape for every synth in the institute wiping out most of the institute  


Minutemen: they would break into the institute and the player would go into Fathers room and get the chance to do a red speech check to merge the institute and the minutemen because Preston might see it as a great opportunity for a thriving settlement and if the speech check is passed then the institute would have peace with the commonwealth

Maybe for plastic, but I doubt it is something very much used in the fallout universe, being highly influenced by the 50s where plastic in products was not common like now. They had many alternatives to create energy too, like Helios One in Fallout NV or simply Hoover Dam, hydraulic energy could have been expended upon. The had enough nuclear materials to create a nuclear amarda capable of wiping humanity, but still, they are lacking oil and for some weird reason, oil is important in a universe where it is useless now ??

63,Fallout,"Has anybody ever noticed that Fallout 4 and the film featuring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, The World’s End, have many similarities story wise?

Let me explain:

The primary antagonistic threat in The World’s End is a network that has been replacing people in the crew’s home town with “blanks” or synthetic humans. This is to apparently neutralise threats across the galaxy, and intertwine the planets together under one system.

This is very similar to the Institutes replacement of humans across the wasteland with “synths”. Their goal is very similar as well, being to “redefine” humanity with their scientific advancements.

Additionally, their methods of integrating into society is the exact same as the network in The World’s End. They slowly replace a small amount of people to achieve their goal.

But finally, both of the endings are the same. In one of the Fallout 4 Endings, the Institute is rigged to explode. This is the exact same as the ending to The World’s End, being the network self destructing after the protagonist, Garry King, convinces it to “fuck off”.

75,Fallout,So the last time I played the game was back in launch. It’s kind of self explanatory why I quit playing it. Just recently I found out that fallout 1st has the ranger NCR armor and you can keep it even after no longer paying for fallout 1st. The real reason I’m probably going to come back is the player base. I’ve seen youtube compilations of 76 and some of people playing it are quite wholesome in a way. There’s a lot of nice people willing to go out of there way to help new players out. There’s also a lot of cosmetics and weapons I think are cool so I will probably end up reinstalling it this weekend and trying it out for a second time.,I’m considering going back to 76

95,Fallout,"Okay, I just had a really weird encounter while I was replaying Far Harbor:

After arriving on the island and following Old Longfellow through the path leading to Acadia, you're stopped by a Child of Atom, who proceeds to inform the player who she is, what her faith is about and why her people don't get along with the folks on the docks, after which you move on. Later, after doing a few side quests, you return to the Far Harbor docks to find that same CoA dead, likely having been gunned down by a certain weapons merchant that resides there. All of this, I've encountered before in previous playthroughs.

This time was different, however.

So, I head through the gates and mill around the town for a minute, do some trading, turn in a side quest, the usual. However, as I'm heading out the gates to leave the town, I notice the CoA's body missing from where I found it. I look up toward the west to see a figure walking away. I run up to get a better look... and see that it's the same exact Child of Atom. Alive and well. Strolling away into the Fog.

113,Fallout,"It feels like, talking about NV, many people completely discourage critical thinking. But they are ready to scold Bethesda for every little thing. Game is praised for its excellent storyline, full completely ignoring meaning itself plot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Main quest is:

(Game begins with a badly drawn video, as if it were a Fallout 2 video opening)

Wake up with amnesia, and instead of leaving dangerous zone, for some reason, get caught up in maelstrom of events in order to deal with your killer, about whom you do not remember anything, and do not know, in order to... do your quest, but still nowhere do not leave, and suddenly start helping or hindering people, who you also completely do not care about. And then we arrange a revolution for one of parties. And in DLC we are doing complete madness in styles of best action movies different genres.

Game literally leads in hand from point to point, across a huge empty boring world, to round islands of events. And so from island to island. Research is almost always of no use at all, leading to dead end.

And in DLC, you can also find out, that you are playing as another Revan, chosen from the prophecy, of Mary Sue, creator and destroyer of humanity, but about whom few people know. And who, somehow, still works as a courier, after what did. And in stupidity plot twist, was shot as a completely ordinary person no skill or position, to be resurrected, and again to do people good... What kind of deus ex macina in a postman's cap is that??? Moreover, if it were not for Obsidian name, people would have shouted, that this plot is banal to point of impossibility.

&amp;#x200B;

Plots about a god, who has lost his memory, became mortal, who gets into other people's affairs, is an Obsidian classic. But for some incredible reason, that's what many players love for... And always this standard chosen one, it's a perfectly average european boi. Obsidian repeats over and over again this scheme from isometric games, inserting them into everything that they are given for outsourcing. And for some reason people like it. And each time, they aggressively defend this, completely ignoring all disadvantages.

To change this terrible scheme, it was enough to make main character an ordinary traveler, who came to Vegas to earn money and luck. And not make mega pretentious NCR anther game symbol. Then character is really free to do what he wants, has moral principles that depend on player choice, and player himself decides what motives character has. But it is known, for sure, that character is simply doing his job to get money. Then character will really have motivation, there will be an explanation of what is doing here, and why character has little skills. And all actions can be explained by - it is just work - and player self invents motivation for character.",Why do people like NV plot?

120,Fallout,"I've been reading into the FO lore and found something which in a weird way fascinates me.   


As we all know, according to lore, after the US spotted Chinese submarines off of their coasts, nuclear missile launches were detected at 09:13 EST and confirmed by NORAD at 09:17 EST.  
As a response to that, at 09:26 EST, the US government (presumably the president) ordered a retaliatory strike according to the so-called scenario MX-CN91.   
At 09:42 EST nuclear detonations in Pennsylvania and New York were confirmed.  
All of this information is accessible at the Switchboard terminal in Fallout 4.   


Now, how realistic is that scenario MX-CN91? As far as I know (which isn't much), there are no further informations or details about this scenario. So how plausible is it that the US government (or any government for that matter) would, after realizing that the enemy launched nukes, decide to basically take the rest of the world down with them? The thought process 'well, we're dead, but we're gonna fire our nukes anyway just to make sure that if we don't survive, no one does' is in a weird way very interesting to me. Because at that point, when the Chinese missile launches were confirmed, they had to be aware that they were going to die, right?

132,Fallout,"So in my opinion you shoudn't side with the NCR or the Legion in the Battle of Hoover Dam because the leadership of both sides are willing to steamrole over the people of the Mojave just to satisfy the imperialistic ambitions, and frankly most of the people that you deal with in the NCR (Moore, Kimball, Oliver) and the Legion (Caesar) are rather condescending and rude.

That is why I have boiled it down to two options: House and Yes Man. But I am having a hard time trying to decide which is best for the people of the Mojave. So who do you think which path is the best option for the Mojave.

But before you do let me just give you an analysis on the pros and cons of both options.

So with House, you got a guy who  seems like a much nicer boss, compared to Kimball and Caesar. He's not exactly good, but he's not exactly bad either. And while, there are those like Arcade who claims that House is a tyrant towards the people of New Vegas there is not much evidence that he has taken any actions to oppress anybody, other than his irrational hatred of mutants and ghouls. Of course on the flip side, with the exception of bringing clean water, electricity, and public order to the denizens of the strip, he hasn't really done anything to improve the lot of the people of Freeside, Westside, and North Vegas, or any of the other settlements in the Mojave. In fact he seems more interested in using the resources of Vegas and the Mojave to complete his grand plan of space colonization. And while it sounds like a noble goal, given the state of the world and all, wouldn't it be better to invest those resources in creating more practical technologies like G.E.C.K.s, solar collectors, and water purifiers and instead of some vanity project. All in all House is definitely the lesser of two evils when compared to the NCR and the Legion, but I'm not sure his vision is the one the Mojave needs right now.

Then there is the other option: Yes Man. So basically as far as I know Yes Man doesn't really have any long-term goals for Vegas or the Mojave, and in all honesty the Wild Card path isn't all that different from the House path, it just gives you more freedom in how you deal with all the various factions. Personally, I'm leaning towards this path because I believe the Wild Card path may ultimately lead towards the creation of a government that is focused on bettering the lives of the people of the Mojave. Granted some of General Oliver's complaints are valid, and a lot of the people who live in the Mojave aren't really that interested in creating infrastructure and businesses let alone nation-building. But I still believe that it is possible to turn the Mojave into a nation that can rival the NCR and the Legion so long as you have the resources, (Big MT and the Sierra Madre), good trade agreements (NCR, Sorrows/Dead Horses, Great Khans) and the right leadership (good/neutral karma charismatic courier, Marcus, the King, Pearl, Julie Farkas). The only thing that worries me is Yes Man, at the end of the game he says that he's going to given himself upgrades that will make him more ""assertive"", but I'm not sure whether that's a good thing. Their is literally no way of telling whether or not these upgrades will make be better, just as bad, or worse than the leaders of the three major factions. And if they do turn him rogue he might try to take over Vegas with the upgraded Securitron army, so he can impose he own dictatorship or autocracy. But other than that this does seem like the best option to go for, unless I am missing something else.

So now that I have made my arguments please feel free to comment on why you think House or Yes Man is the best choice for the people of the Mojave.",Which Fallout: NV ending is the best for the people of the Mojave and why: Yes Man or House?

**Nuclear Jazz Radio (NJR 93.2)** aims to mimic the news broadcasters of Fallout 3, 4 and New Vegas. I've published 8 episodes, and I'm pretty proud of how far it's come. I figure it can be a good companion to day-to-day life, as well as an enhancement to any Fallout-based TTRPGs you or your friends might be running.

If you're reading this and you're a video game modder/developer, I'd love to collaborate on a project. This was really fun to create. Check out my website [AYLA HEKE](https://aylaheke.com) if you'd like to get in touch and see the other projects we're working on.

I'm actively working on Season 2. Let me know if you want to be notified when that gets uploaded. Happy to send out some DMs.

164,Fallout,"Oh boy. I was prepared for the Ghost People. The radios and speakers. The goddamn red cloud. Or so I thought. 

I was dead wrong.

So, this is my first ever hardcore playthrough of New Vegas, after 6 or so playthroughs (and after over a year of not playing the game). I also decided something different: why not go light armor, using one handed guns (OHG) for the first time to spice things up a bit? I figured it would be fun to change up the playstyle for a bit after rushing for a rifleman character, or a mean heavy gunner, which I did a lot of. Nothing feels better than sniping with Annabelle, then whipping out Mercy or the Avenger for close up shenanigans to me!

So anyway, I speedran to the Novac part of the main quest, after gambling at the atomic wrangler to get the intelligence implant (and at the Vikki and Vance to get more money) and decided: I’m gonna get that Reinforced Sierra Madre armor right now. I would need some serious DT to compensate for my relatively weak guns and skills at level 9. Not to mention the fact that I can’t simply rely on having multiple guns at once due to the ammo weight. 

And so I did. Went straight for the Abandoned bunker and got myself kidnapped into the Sierra Madre. And after talking to Elijah, I notice I’m taking damage... seemingly out of nowhere...? “What? I’m not walking into the clouds...” I think. Until Elijah explains the cloud and I remember: this is hardcore baby. Time’s ticking. And now I fully realize why some people thought the clouds were so damn annoying. I never considered hardcore mode could change that to be even harder. And that’s on top of stripping the player from their food and stimpaks. Goddamn was I not expecting it.

I already had learned to be cautious with the physical needs of hardcore. But having the cloud just made stimpaks and Dr.bags so much more important. Suddenly those damn seekers are so much worse now. Not only do they have pixel perfect accuracy, the gas tank is bugged (which means I can’t blow it up) and I need to get even more Dr. bags to heal their ridiculous limb damage (detail, I’m a small framed Courier. Fun!). And that’s on top of the cloud damage I’m taking constantly. Am I finally gonna have to rely on *vending machines* to keep stocked up? 

Honestly I’m just amazed. Dead Money was always a breeze with the Bear Trap Fist and just the speakers were annoying but in Hardcore I feel like it’s a totally different approach compared to the base game and the other DLCs. I can’t just wander around anymore, the urgency is actually there! I’m way more immersed now than I was at any point of my past playthroughs. Man if only the lighting and radios didn’t completely suck, the DLC would’ve been so much more loved with this kind of urgency, it’s insane how much hardcore mode changes my enjoyment of the DLC for the better.",My first time playing Dead Money on Hardcore

168,Fallout,"Here's my pitch

The game would take place in colorado, near the rockies. It would focus on the NCR vs BOS for control of the cheyenne mountain complex, which is in the hands of the last members of the enclave. The setting would be mountainous and snowy with some grassland dessert as you go off the mountains. The major factions would the previously mentioned NCR, BOS, Enclave, and the masters army. The enclave would seal themselves inside the complex and the eastern BOS and NCR would come to Colorado. The masters army would be leaderless but in charge of most of the area.

As for the player character. You would be from vault 200, the experiment would be the overseer lead a jonestownesk cult. And half the dwellers have been over the years indoctrinated into the cult. A civil war breaks out in the vault and you are exiled.

The gameplay would be that of FO4 with the story aspects of NV. The Rockstone commonwealth would span over the mountains and the Denver/colorado springs area. The smaller factions would be the settlement, a fledgeling colony where the railroad sends liberated synths.

**Fallout New Orleans**

Set 30 years after the events of Fallout 4, Fallout New Orleans, (FNO), is a sequel to Fallout 4. It's stories are connected in some ways. It is May 1st, 2318.

You play as the main protagonist Thomas Breaux/Elizabeth Hebert.

The game starts on October 23rd, 2077. You are riding a motorcycle in Gulfport, Mississippi when the game begins. The radio cuts out and you get switched to another station.

“Alert! Alert! This is not a drill! Bombs have been reported by affiliate stations in Los Angeles, Boston, Miami, and New York. I repeat, this is not a drill. Any Vault-Tec personnel have been ordered to their respective vaults. All members of any vault are being requested to head to your designated vault with haste. It is only a matter of time until-“

Then the bomb drops. You look around confused as to why the radio stopped, but then you look up to a gigantic mushroom cloud over New Orleans.

You try to drive away, but eventually have to bail behind a building. You pull out your phone to the contacts; Thomas/Elizabeth is the contact. (Depends on who you chose).

You drop the phone as you fell the heat, then the radiation. Your character drops to the floor- blanking out.

You switch to the character you actually chose.

5 MINUTES EARLIER

“This is a Vault-Tec important notice. It seems that there have been bombs dropped on multiple United States cities. Please begin to head to your designated vault now. Thank you for choosing Vault-Tec.”

You pick up your child, Noah, and grab a suitcase from the table.

“Damnit! Julie was right. Let’s go Noah. Dad will meet us there.”

You head to the vault and then, as you eventually get to the loading bay, you hear a loud bang and turn around. You see a ginormous mushroom cloud looming over New Orleans. You and Noah are quickly brought underground as the heat wave begins to fly over.

You play through a few years of vault life- obviously sped up. You are in Vault 504. You play through Noah's birthday, a few Vault events, etc. Eventually, in the year 2089, the vault runs out of food. Everyone is ordered to their designated cyro-pods. The player and Noah are then frozen for over 200 years until they are unfrozen in 2318.

**CONNECTION TO FALLOUT 4**

Vault-Tec has since abandoned the vault, but all vault dwellers are alive. The player and other characters wander about for a while until they see [Nate](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nate). Nate, after the events of Fallout 4, set out to restore some normalcy to the wastelands. You learn that Nate has traveled from Boston and has helped build up cities and settlements all throughout the East Coast.

Nate came across the vault sealed up and had wondered if there was anyone stuck inside there after having memories of Overseer Barstow. The vault dwellers thank Nate, and then before he goes, you talk to him and ask him if he needs any help.

""I'm actually heading to New Orleans right now. It would be great if I could have some help who knows the local areas.""

You then join Nate on a trip to New Orleans. Once in New Orleans, Nate informs you that he's planning on staying there for a while. He says if you ever need him you can contact him on a spare pipboy that he hands you.

**MAIN STORY**

In Fallout 5, the main storyline is one that revolves around New Orleans. After finding yourself in New Orleans, you head to the Superdome. When you arrive, you meet a group of members of a faction named ""Brotherhood of the Swamp"". After you arrive, you end up getting asked if you'd like to join them. They give you an initiation quest.

*This Smells... Fishy*: This the first full quest of the game. You are tasked with clearing out a couple of shacks infested with Crawgators, Radfish, and Radflys, along with Mutant Crawfish.

You have to clear out the shack in the search of a missing faction member- Jean Franco-Baptiste Bernard. Once clearing it out, you find the corpse of a Brotherhood member. He has a holo-tape that says that they retreated into the shack, and that the others made it into the bunker. His corpse has a key on it for the bunker.

Once you make it in, you find a crazed Jean. He hasn't been seen in over 30 days. He is malnutritioned and on the brink of insanity.

You bring him back to where the Brotherhood told you to meet them at, Audubon Zoo. Once there, you come across their main base of operations in New Orleans. (They have multiple).

Eventually, later in the story, you'll meet ""The Protectors of the Land"". They are a faction dedicated to preserving and redeveloping land in the swamp.

You'll meet a few more factions, and the main story will have you working for different factions- along with Nate, in order to find out information about a secret organization that plans to use an undetonated nuke on a Chinese Submarine in order to take out the few remaining factions of the wasteland.

The end of the story is when you breach the submarine, and are able to save the city, but then you have to divert it to one of the main factions' headquarters, forever deleting them from the game. After this quest, two factions will have died. There is also an option to side with the secret organization and help build additional nukes in order to eliminate all of the factions in the New Orleans area.

**FACTIONS OF THE PELICAN STATE**

[Link to theory map. Black area is barren wasteland and completely unlivable.](https://imgur.com/a/fRaf8Rj)

*Brotherhood of the Swamp:* The Brotherhood of the Swamp is a militaristic faction that is based in the city of Houma, Louisiana. They were formed more than 150 years ago by Dean Francis. Ever since, they have used their impressive numbers in both men and equipment to keep peace and order in the Pelican State, but especially in New Orleans. Their primary region of control is the marsh and swamp in and around Houma.  HQ is in Houma.

*Protectors of the Land:* The Protectors of the Land were created as a direct counter to the Brotherhood. They are in a strong alliance with The Floridian Confederation and Cajun Navy. These three have formed the Anti-Brotherhood Pact. They control Easternmost areas of the map. HQ is in Belle Chasse.

*The Establishment:* The Establishment controls most of what was Metropolitan New Orleans plus some. It is one of the bigger, and the most powerful faction. It is also known as the ""Secret Organization"". It is a highly classified faction, and it is the most civilized of the lots. Although they may be seen as the most dangerous, they also commonly give the most humanitarian options for anybody under their rule. This faction will give the player lots of moral dilemmas. You'll find out towards the end of the story, however, that a little bit of Voodoo and magic might be affecting how everything seems to you, and maybe everyone else is right in their concerns of the Establishment. HQ is in the Superdome.

*The Floridian Confederation:* The Floridian Confederation is the second strongest faction, but also the biggest. They have control over all of Florida, and the Gulf Coast up to Louisiana. They are not as militaristically advanced as the Establishment, however. HQ is in Miami.

*Cajun Navy:* The Cajun Navy is a naval based faction. They are militaristically inferior to their neighbors, but are in the Anti-Brotherhood Pact and have a superior navy. They are also very wild; they do not live by many morals. HQ is in Port Sulphur.

*The Pelican Confederation:* The Pelican Confederation is a faction that had merged out of four minor factions. Together they rose against the Brotherhood in 2200, and broke through to Houma, making them accept a peace treaty. Tensions have since risen again. HQ is in Morgan City.

*Children of the Magnolia:* This faction is a cultist, religious group that believes that Hades, Greek God of the Underworld, had sent the bombs.

**CONCLUSION**
Fallout: New Orleans would be a very cultural based game, getting a lot of inspiration from New Orleans, Cajun, and Voodoo culture. The story would be connected to Fallout 4 through Nate. 

This is all a theory, of course, and Bethesda likely already have started on the next Fallout games details. Plus, we likely won’t have Fallout 5 for another 5+ years. Let me know what you think.",Fallout New Orleans- An unofficial sequel to Fallout 4.

176,Fallout,"I don't have a lot of specific details about some upcoming reveals, especially things after this year or Elder Scrolls VI, but I know enough from this year to share.

- Fallout 4 Special Edition, early November 2021. Will be on Xbox Game Pass.
- Fallout 4 The Stars Above DLC, included in Special Edition, not available for the original release. Will take players to the moon as well as a space station above Fallout 4's Commonwealth. Bigger than Far Harbor and will tie into Fallout 76's Tales from the Stars update and to celebrate Starfield's release.
- No official Fallout 3 or New Vegas remasters, due to the success of certain mod teams in the Fallout communities, as well as Bethesda not wanting to dismiss the efforts of fan creators.
- The next Fallout will NOT be made by Bethesda's main studio, and is in pre-production limbo until *after* a certain studio finishes their current efforts. Will be using the same version of the engine as Fallout 4 Special Edition.
- As such, Bethesda is working entirely on Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI and no new titles until *both* are complete in order to maintain quality control. Yes, they're serious about that sort of thing this time. This will amount to longer development times and thus a farther-out release schedule, for the latter at least, because Starfield is set to release this year.
- Microsoft purchase has caused Bethesda to readjust their stance on partnering with certain development studios. Take that as you will.

Thanks",Companions weapons disappeared when exiting Casinos
180,Fallout,"And in my opinion, that's settlers with names, personalities, and their own unique quests.

Sure, there are your companions that you can send to any settlement you want, but that doesn't really count imo because I'm talking about settlers. And besides acquiring the Vault Tec salesman, who doesn't really do anything himself accept be another settler, he's not all that special. And I feel like this is a hugely messed opportunity to make the settlement system actually something special.

One of favorite game franchises of the ps2 generation was the Dark Cloud series, and it sort of had a build your own town component to it too. And while it may not be in depth, it did have very unique characters who all distinctly wanted things that only you could provide, like where they wanted to live next to or what they wanted added to their house.

Imagine how fun it could have been if you acquired someone who really wanted to start their own radio station. So they'd ask you to build them a place that could be their studio, with a functioning radio tower. Then, after you finish building him his radio station you could tune to it during the game at any time and listen to him. That would have been awesome.

Or perhaps someone whose backstory was that their lest home was attacked and destroyed by raiders, and that he'd never feel safe until there was a wall and turrets surrounding his house. Now, you could just build a wall and turrets around his house only, or you could put it around the whole settlement and that would be equally as valid. Then, also, perhaps the radio man that you built a radio station for will comment on the new defenses while you go out an adventure.

Or, maybe you have someone who likes to fish, so they request that wherever you put their house it would be next to the river. And as a consequence of fulfilling their request you'll get more fish and fish related foods for sale in your general store, that also generates a little more money for your settlement.

Things like that would have made the settlement system so much more memorable in my opinion. Because the way it is only feel like it only matters as far as you really want to invest in making it look aesthetically good, because the settlers don't have any names, and they only give you generic radiant quests at random from time to time that are not memorable. You only care about the people as far as the stats are involved.

I'll be honest though. I don't ""hate"" the concept of a settlement building in Fallout or Elder Scrolls. I just dislike how it's been implemented. Like, Bethesda knew that everyone might not care for it so they made it that you could ignore it entirely if you wanted to. But the consequence of that is that... it doesn't feel all that important obviously.

Also, and this pretty peeves me off, but you can only floors and ceilings and stuff down flatly, and Fallout almost never has any flat terrain. So it often looks like your buildings are floating a little off the ground and that sucks.",What I feel Fallout 4's settlement system lacked.

The Atmosphere: With both Beta Fallout 76 and the current version, the atmosphere was always on point. The world truly felt as though it was empty. Everyone was dead but the world still felt full of life, with all of the little tidbits scattered around the map. Another thing I think it did well was its portrayal of Pre-War American life. It portrays it like Fallout 4 should have, riddled with civil strife, the threat of automation stealing your job  constantly looming, and the overall corruption in Appalachia and the United States. It really sells this with stuff like, events where you suppress protestors, and  audio logs found throughout the map (Otis Pike’s Story really shows this.)

The Lore: I love and hate what Fallout 76 does with lore, I love the backstory for the Raiders, but I hate the fact that Roger Maxson moved through Appalachia despite earlier lore saying otherwise. But I generally love what it does with both the Raiders and the Enclave. Rose is one of my favorite characters in any Fallout game. Modus is also really cool, and the connections with him and Henry Eden really make sense.

The World: The world and graphics of Fallout 76 is absolutely stunning. The world feels real and alive. There are so many nooks and crannies to explore and discover. The story is told through notes and holotapes, which I  think really fits the overall theme.

Overall, Fallout 76 is a very flawed game, but its definitely getting better and is totally worth a second chance.",What Fallout 76 Did Right
185,Fallout,[removed],What Fallout 76

(also i was playing with mods, but even with mods disabled i cant reload)",Cant Reload my Guns in Fallout 4 (PS4)
187,Fallout,"Fallout 4 made a lot of controversial changes, like the alterations to it's dialogue system, he introduction of settlement building, and the meter-based critical hit mechanic. Whilst these decisions all have boy supporters and opponents, there is one criticism I see repeatedly about its main story that I just don't think is fair.

Specifically, the idea that it's too linear when compared to previous entries in the franchise.

Let's consider the first game's main story. The Vault Dweller must find the water chip (there is only one, in one location) and bring it back to vault 13. Then, he or she must resolve the mutant issue, eventually leading to the Master's Cathedral, where the Dweller can kill the Master, convince the Master to commit suicide, or join the Unity. The branching options here are in the ability to skip clues (sequence-breaking through out-of-character knowledge) and the fact that additional dialogue options (including the aforementioned suicide) can be accessed if the Dweller has explored optional areas enough.

Then there's Fallout 2, which curiously enough has a main plot which becomes branchier in the middle, and a lot more linear again towards the end. Whilst interactions with various factions can give different options for reaching the Enclave Oil Rig, the Chosen One must kill the President and the head of the Secret Service, resulting in the base being destroyed.

Fallout 3 does something similar, fitting with its ""alpha and omega"" theme. There are several ways to acquire clues, skip large portions of the plot, and enter Little Lamplight. Once the GECK is acquired, however, the plot becomes fairly straightforward, with a final major choice at the end.

Fallout New Vegas has a quite linear first act up to entering the Strip, with several options after that point. From that point, almost all the other elements of the game are skippable, depending on faction choice, with Yes Man being able to ignore almost all other factions and sidequests, whilst the NCR can bypass the Platinum Chip altogether. No matter what, though, the story will always end on Hoover Dam, fighting across either east to west, or west to east.

Fallout 4, by contrast, has arguably three different endings, each with radically different quest structures. One can destroy the Institute with the aid of another faction (The Nuclear Option), one choice with three variations. Alternatively, one can side WITH the Institute and destroy the Brotherhood of Steel by overriding their superweapon (Airship Down). As a final option, one can play the factions against one another, having the Railroad destroy the Brotherhood (Rocket's Red Glare) then wiping the Railroad leadership out on behalf of the Institute (the Sole Survivor can explicitly tell Father that he or she simply used the Railroad until they were no longer useful, avoiding both the Nuclear Option AND Airship Down.

Furthermore, the player is given considerable freedom in how to handle the factions. The Railroad can be eliminated upon first contact if the player wishes it, permanently closing off that faction. The Brotherhood and the Institute can't be destroyed as easily, but they can be permanently made enemies of the first time the Sole Survivor meets Danse and Father. The Brotherhood questline has an interesting variation if Madison Li cannot be recruited. As an especially interesting twist, the faction which can wipe out two of the others and go on to be he most powerful in the game is completely optional. The entire Minuteman questline and all of its NPCs can be avoided if the player chooses.

The nonlinearity starts earlier than people tend to remember, too. There are a myriad of ways to be directed towards Nick Valentine, including an option for players who travel to Goodneighbour first. Alternatively, it can be sequence-broken, by heading straight to Park Street station.",There is a case to be made for Fallout 4's main story being the least linear out of the whole franchise.
188,Fallout,"Hi! I recently got Tale of Two Wastelands working on my Fallout install and I'm having a great time.

I'm mainly interested in the Nuka Chemist VS Quantum Chemist perks. I realize there won't be MUCH difference since Nuka Chemist basically does that better, but Nuka Cola Quantum wasn't part of Nuka Chemist in default New Vegas so it could still make sense for Quantum to either be its own thing, or to update Nuka Chemist.

And what makes even less sense is that 3 of your companions who are immune to radiation refuse to turn on the purifier even though they can survive it. Like, yeah, I get they will if Broken Steel is installed but if you aren't playing the dlc then the arguments for them not going in make no sense.

250,Fallout,"Fallout mods are a great thing. Modding as a whole are great for Bethesda's games. And many have made or are making whole ""games"" in mods, such as Fallout 2 having fanmade game-sized mods, Fallout 3 in Fallout 4, New Vegas in Fallout 4, and even The Frontier.

And one thing I personally would like to make is a completely new ""game"" using either Fallout: New Vegas or Fallout 4. And basically what I'm asking here is thoughts on the basic premise (just a basic premise so it isn't exactly fleshed out) and possibly things some may want/expect.

Basically, you come from a raider gang as second in command (or just highly trusted) and are sent out to scout new land as the gang your with is looking to expand. You scout the new area, find any settlements and try to get them on your side or make them not a risk. These settlements will have differing ways to interact with them, slavery, diplomacy, political, etc. Some settlements will be immune to one method or harder to do a method, some are rivals and you have to choose which would be better for your gang, stuff like that.

Well mine is my fashion sense. I bet you'd be shaking in your boots if you saw a grown man running towards you in a worn out green dress, chefs hat, dog by his side and holding a laser rifle!

Most of my time spent in Fallout 4 whilst scavenging is realising I can wear something I'd never normally wear in a Fallout game! Whilst travelling I came accross a wig and baseball outfit and you can bet your lucky stars I shot up the Diamond City security in it whilst they were fighting super mutants. I'll always be prepared to waste a couple of stimpacks to look stupid whilst fighting even the most deadliest creatures like deathclaws or super mutants.

Problem #1. No PC/never owned one. I plan on buying one eventually for mods but it seems pretty intimidating since I don't know anything about modding on computers. 

Problem #2. I only have a PS4 and a Switch. As far as I'm aware new vegas was never released on ps4 or the switch. 

Problem #3 PSnow actually has FNV so I paid the 60$ for the membership. What I didn't know is that PSnow doesn't include the dlc to many of the games AND the game looks absolutely terrible because it's a streaming service. Like it looks really bad. 

Problem #4 Xbox game pass (which I have on my phone) just released all the bethesda games on game pass mobile EXCEPT FNV. I was devastated. 


Looking online for a used Xbox seemed to be my only solution, but unfortunately I'm in a small town and the video game scene is pretty weak. Facebook marketplace just had broken ones or people were asking $300 for a xbox 360. Finally after months of waiting I call my local game store and they just got a 360 in the store and they were testing it. 

They wanted $100 bucks for it. Seemed to be a slim model 4gb with a 250gb add on. Decent deal. Even comes with a controller. So I buy it and a copy of FNV and Fallout 3, Got home plugged the console in and after 2 hours of trying to remember emails and passwords I finally remember my old Xbox gamer tag from years ago. (Rip my friends list so sad 😭) 

After the account is set up Skyrim booted up??? They left a copy in the 360 for me I think it was a joke lmao. I then proceed to buy all the FNV DLC on the old 360 gamestore annnnd I'm ready. Ready to relive one of the greatest games of all time. I press start on the game and update it. BOOM disc doesn't work. I go to the game store and get another copy. Doesn't work. 3rd times the charm right? I go back to the game store slightly irritated and ask for another copy. Go home. The game doesn't work.

Skyrim works, fallout3 works. But not new vegas? Something is fishy. I then proceed to delete the initial update for FNV and then reinstall it. Will it work? Will I be forever cursed to not play this wonderful game? 

To my surprise deleting that update worked. I am now level 19 and I haven't even step foot on the strip yet and it's as wonderful as I remembered.

290,Fallout,"In case if you don't know what the Enclave are, they're essentially a contingency plan for the United States government to survive in the event of nuclear war. Their main base was a Poseidon oil rig on the coast of California, however they were pretty much scattered throughout the United states. My question is, do you guys think nate knew about them? He was serving around the time the Enclave was being established, and he has just about the military background to be important enough to the United States to be shared secrets to, him being a war hero and whatnot.

This is just a thought I had and one I discussed with my friend. I've been thinking about it more because I recently started an Enclave build in Fallout 4. I think it's possible, but not probable.

293,Fallout,"Hello, fallout fans I showcasing an idea for fallout mod's new game set in New Mexico. I need some feedback for this coming project and things that should be added in the future. Here my design document intro. Also, if want a taste of what a fallout game set in New Mexico would look like try out Fallout 1.5: Resurrection (Fallout 2 mod) (Note everything in this future project to change and I am still working on this project idea.)

•	Fallout: New Mexico takes place in May 2296, 15 years after Fallout: New Vegas and 9 years after Fallout 4. 219 years after the great war. With the death of Caesar during the events of Fallout: New Vegas the legion quickly implodes into Civil War among Ceasar legion legates across Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado up to Denver, and eastern Utah. This lead to the event call Wars of legions which cause a 15-long war between the many legions across these regions. (This civil war is much like Alexander’s Successor’s Wars of the Diadochi who become successor states of Ptolemaic Kingdom, and the Seleucid Empire. At the same time, this creates a Migration Period or known as the Barbarian Invasions where the western roman empire fell while the eastern roman empire becomes the byzantine empire.) Much like the events of the Migration Period the raider tribes and other legions factions fight to gain control remains of the Ceasar legion. The Ceasars legates quickly fighting against each other and some of them simply split off from the legion to from their legions and forming their own identities. While some of them turn back into raider gangs who raid the settlements across the New Mexico Wasteland. Besides new and old raider tribes have moved to various parts of New Mexico. Taking advantage of the chaos and lack of security to raid settlements in the region. Settlements who are not under control by the legions return to their original identities and customs. The lesser legions who survive the wars from their legion identities and customs across the wasteland control parts of New Mexico Wasteland. By the time Fallout: New Mexico starts there a massive struggle among major factions. Where each of these major factions wants to take control of the New Mexico Wasteland. 

1.	Kingdom of Santa Fe

17.	Red Legion

18.	Augustus's Legion

19.	Aurelian's Legion

20.	Stilicho's and Aetius's Legion

The Prisoner, the player’s character, is more or less a clean slate, up awakes in a locked cell after a recent prison riot had happened to leave them forever locked in the room. The remaining guards and prisoners are left in the wastes. One day the door in their cell mysteriously opens where a prisoner can more than fewer ventures the New Mexico wasteland and eventually change the New Mexico Wasteland forever. 

•	Locations: The are three main game worlds and alongside mini-game worlds in New Mexico Wasteland. The player can almost explore the whole New Mexico state as well parts of Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. 

Main game worlds

1.	New Mexico Central Wasteland. (The World would encompass from surrounding areas around Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Los Alamos, Springer, and Taos.)

2.	New Mexico Southern Wasteland. (The World would encompass from surrounding areas around Silver City, El Paso, Ciudad Juarez Mexico, Las Cruces, Deming, Lordsburg, Alamogordo, Carlsbad, and Roswell.)

3.	New Mexico FourCorners Wasteland. (The World would encompass from surrounding areas around Four Corners Monument, Monument Valley, Ignacio, Chinle, Blanding, Cortez, Durango, Farmington, Shiprock, Dove Creek, and Navajo Lake State Park.) 

Mini-game worlds - These locations serve as their mini-game worlds like The Witcher 3 game worlds of Kaer Morhen and Skellige and classical games of Fallout 1 and Fallout 2.

 1.	New Mexico Gallup Wasteland. (The World would encompass from the surrounding area, Gallup, Zuni Reservation, Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation, Window Rock, Ganado, Chambers, Thoreau, Crownpoint, and Grants)

2.	New Mexico Very Large Array Wasteland. (The World would encompass the surrounding area, San Antonio, Socorro, Very Large Array, Datil, Alamo, and Belen.)

3.	New Mexico Fort Summer Wasteland. (The World would encompass from the surrounding area, Lake Sumner, Santa Rosa, Tucumcari Fort Sumner, Clovis, Portales, and Elida.)

4.	New Mexico Craters Valley Wasteland. (The World would encompass from the surrounding area, Mountainair, Estancia, Vaughn, and Corona) A number of meteors from space have crashed land this region. Creating an alien landscape much like the Divide and big empty.

5.	New Mexico Jicarilla Apache Nation Reservation Wasteland. (The World would encompass from the surrounding area, Dulce, Chimney Rock, Pagosa Springs, Chama, and Tierra Amarilla.)

•	Fallout: New Mexico Tone - The main theme deals with aftershocks of Caesar’s death regardless of what happen Fallout: New Vegas and effects of civil war across New Mexico. It deals with effects of a long prolong war ranging from the economy, destruction of infrastructure, labor force, displacement, education, resources, security, gender, civilian casualties, artistic and other things that affect society from war. It must deal with the effects of a newly fallen civilization in a post-nuclear world where it's a return to the new Dark Age again. The main times are inspired by the Roman Civil Wars and Migration Period throughout Roman history. It will show a real sense of the decline of the Ceasar legion and New Mexico Wasteland as a whole much like the decline of the Western Roman Empire.",Fallout: New Mexico.

297,Fallout,"As we learned from the Point Lookout DLC for FO3, Desmond Lockhart and Professor Calvert were seeking to destroy each other in an effort to become the winner of ""The Great Game"". The Wiki lists it as a ""Post-War"" rivalry, but if we remember from our conversation with Desmond, he mentions that this started BEFORE the war, and that he and Calvert weren't the only participants. My question is: Who else is playing?

Robert House? Then man hellbent on self preservation, to the point that he equipped his home at the Lucky 38 with laser cannons to destroy the 77 missiles headed towards Las Vegas? The man who created his own life support device and placed himself inside before the imminent destruction of the world around him?

John Caleb Bradburton? Similar story to House, except with Nuka-Cola. Partners with Vault-Tec to build his own Vault underneath Nuka World. Has RobCo build his robotic security.

303,Fallout,"I've played through the game a few times but never really went in for the romance and relationships. I usually used Danse, Preston, Codsworth or Dogmeat as followers and maintained a more... shall we say; professional realtionship.

I've been running with Piper recently and gone through all of her dialogue, but due to my super hardcore mods my Specials are very low, so I didn't meet the requirements for any of her romance options and just had to dunk her into the friendzone. Is there any way to re-trigger her romance dialogue? Could I lower then raise her affinity? I'll likely romance Curie anyway, so I'll be prepared before travelling with her. It just seems a little unfair if you can't ever have another go at pursuing a relationship if your Charisma was just a little low the first time around. It's hard to predict when they'll stop you and present an opportunity to make a move. Though you can postpone the dialogue until you're ready I guess. What if you're under the effects of something that lowers your Charisma and you blow it? I guess it's realistic in that way.

305,Fallout,"Think bout it. You have several interaction with amata during your childhood life. You were friendly enough with amata for her to throw a surprise birthday for you. 

Although not as important. The overseer will always mention that not everybody likes you. 

At the age of 16/18. Before goat test. You can either help her and gain good k. or join the fun for bad k. or ignore Tunnel Snake bullying Amata because they rule and go inside the classroom to do the goat test which can imply Amata relationship with the Lone Wanderer during this time skip can mean Lone Wanderer is still her besties or stranger who used to be friend once upon a time or even worse, who will also torment her just to gain the Tunnel Snake respect so they won't torment you or for the lols and the giggles because the Lone Wanderer is a psychopath/sociopath.

From there Amata reason to help you because she deeply respect your Dad because hes literally a saint who has a very good karma even though you're probably worse than Butch.

And if you and Amata are still besties from your previous action. She can help you more by giving you a 10mm pistol which of course she stole it from her dad.

So at one point you probably got yourself a .32 pistol or a chinese one. After escaping vault 101. 

I mean seriously who just wake up from bed and start smashing people heads who you used to know since childhood.

The more you think about the flaws of BGS game the more you realize how incomplete it is/rush the game.

309,Fallout,"I recently saw a documentary on the Pepsi Number Fever in the Philippines.  Essentially, in the midst of the so-called Cola Wars of the 90s, Pepsi wanted to boost their sales numbers against Coke.  They decided print numbers on bottle caps and announce the winning numbers in TV.  The winner would receive 1 million pesos - a huge amount in a developing country.  The contest was wildly popular, but also had a dark side, leading to theft and murders over supposedly winning bottle caps. (Sound familiar?)  In a massive fuckup, one of the numbers Pepsi announced was previously printed as a losing number, inadvertently leading some 800 winners.  Faced with the prospect of paying out such a massive sum, Pepsi welched on the award, leading to nationwide riots and more than a few deaths.

Since this event took place in 1992, I'm wondering if the overlapping narratives are more than just coincidence.  Can anyone comment in this?

I hated all of the DLC's. I especially hated the Nuka World story. It was lame to hedge out areas and have total control over anything. And becoming a raider sucked. Clearly a half-assed attempt to shove in an evil path, and it clashed horribly. (I should have brought Nick Valentine with me when I did this, so I could have a reason to shoot his ass.)

I constantly found myself bored to tears with the story and wondered when it would all end. I bet the writer shat out this story thinking we would all focus on settlement building.

317,Fallout,"So for those of you who are new to the game, need an early start or simply didn’t know about this, there’s a very easy xp exploit in Fallout New Vegas right as you start the game. It requires a lot of patience, strong will, and a speech or barter skill of at least 25. Go to the saloon in good springs and do the bear minimum for the tutorial. After that, talk to joe cobb after the fight in the bar and tell him you’ll help him take over good springs. Kill Ringo and return to him where he’ll tell you to meet his gang. I recommend saving before you then start killing him and his men (shouldn’t be much of a challenge depending on difficulty). After they’re dead, go to the general store to the left of the saloon and talk to Chet. There will be an infinite speech/barter check to give ammo and leather armour to the powder gangers. Keep doing this for a few hours and you’ll also have an unlimited amount of caps as you can sell the leather armour and wait for his stock to resupply. The xp you get from the speech check will level you up after doing it again and again",New Vegas XP exploit

And finally the broken mess that not even the biggest contrarians will defend that is Fallout 76. When Obsidian was given the chance, they made Fallout: New Vegas in only 18 months.

Instead of feral ghouls, we get Bloaters, ferals with skin equivalent to the thing's skin, with lava flowing through the cracks. The bloaters would be able to spew out lava at enemies, and explode in a min-nuke size explosion two seconds after death, spraying lava everywhere. Other wasteland creatures would look like the ones you see in the games, but also special ones with similar skin to these bloaters, and blow up just like the bloaters. Wanting to face a lava deathclaw would be a Deathwish.

The larger, Diamond City Sized cities built fortified cities, and have deterents for these bloaters to avoid total destruction of their settlements.

The raider gangs have power based on claimed land, killing each other to take more land. Land for slaves to grow food and nurture their needs.

Lakes and rivers are either covered in ash, cooled the spilt lava into stone, or left untouched. The untouched waters are valuable to the raider gangs, but seawater at coastal areas are purified for use too.

The area right at the vicinity of the yellowstone volcano is still packed with hot stones and lava. The perfect place for people to have their final battles and final stands. A finale for the many storylines that could occur in this world.

So yeah, my trophy count isn't surpassing the four bronze trophies I got St the very beginning of the game, I simply won't. 

However as I've played over the course of these couple of years, I've began to see how utterly inept and downright neglectful Bethesda and Sony have been towards this port's modding community. 

To illustrate this point, allow me to paint a picture of a frequent predicament I find myself in:

Recently, I've began a Pirate themed build for this game (The FudgeMuppet one actually, if you're familiar with them). However that aside, it's generally themed around chems, booze and adventuring, but especially chems. And so, I decided to make my way to Goodneighbor to recruit Hancock, and maybe snag Cait while I'm around the downtown area of Boston. 

The issue around this has actually plagued me a lot longer then when I began this playthrough. It's that whenever I enter the right side of the downtown area (basically, anywhere east of Charles View Amphitheater) my game shits itself and boots me out, which just adds to the tedium of the load times in this game, which may take up to several minutes. Even if I attempt to skirt around this area, to try and quickly enter locations and immediately fast travel away, there's a chance my game even boots me out while I'm INSIDE a location. 

Another example of this is when you enter the Boston Common to find Nick in the main quest. I uninstalled every graphics mod for my game, and that seemed to have decreased the chance if it happening, however it persisted nonetheless, mod or not. 

This issue didn't actually get noticeable for a good year or so, wherein I would be able to run around Boston Downtown, even with some really heavy mods that  would add stuff to downtown and not not for crash. 

So, me thinking smartly, decided to install a mod that enables  quick access to certain major locations through radiant motorcycles placed by the mod (It's the Starlight Barricade mode for those familiar with it) With this, I would be able to sidestep the crashing issue, and get into Goodneighbor without any trouble. However as I loaded into my file, my game crashed before my game even booted up, in the loading screen. 

Already extremely irritated, attempted to get into my file over and over for maybe 10 minutes or so, bit I eventually lost my battle against my piece if shit machine, and went to disable this troublesome mod, so that I could at least. Only when I went to do so, by game even ""crashed"" at the main menu, after trying to open the mod menu to remove it. 

I did manage to get it open after several tries, and left the menu again, only for my game to crash again. Embarrassingly, on Bethesda and Sony's part, I was now on my 12th game crash over the course of several minutes, through no fault of my own. 

The only thing my mind wanders to in a time like this, is how the modding function of this game is even in this state to begin with. It's downright unacceptable that Sony and Bethesda, two multi-million (and billion, in Sony's case) dollar companies could fuck up this badly, while everyone just seems to accept it. Not once have I heard a peep about people actively discussing this disgrace of a system and actively defying it. Instead, everyone I see who discusses it just have this ""lay down and die attitude""

""Ah golly gee, thanks Sony, I can't download proper hecking mods, I sure hope you go easy on us in the next title!""

No, they won't change anything about this. And considering their acquisition from Microsoft, I'm willing to say the modding and general game experience for those on a PS5 (because they would never think to do a port for previous gen, by the time of Fallout 5) will actively get worse. They're gonna continue shafting the PlayStation player, to appease their Microsoft paymasters. 

Now I'm probably not the first to say this, but I'm already not a huge fan of Sony, or even Bethesda for that matter. I am however, a fan of Fallout, and I find it both horrendous and despicable that Sony and Bethesda so carelessly chopped up this excuse of a modding system, and even actively neutered it, when they certainly have the funds and resources to make something that doesn't literally break your fucking console. For a series with a legacy like Fallout, it makes me sick to even think about how far it's fallen. 

I also find it borderline unethical, that they even had the nerve to artificially lower the quality of every possible mod on this console, by disallowing custom assets to be used. And before you all inevitably comment the tired old excuse of:

""Oh but Samurai, they HAVE to do that, otherwise the hackers and very bad bad people could add stuff to the console, that Sony doesn't want!""

Bullshit on that. It's my fucking console, I should be able to add whatever fucking assets I damn well want. I played full price for this machine, it's mine, not Sony's. 

It should never be a chore for players to do basic shit in a fucking video game they played full price for. Not only am I at my breaking point with Sony and Bethesda, I'm also at my breaking with Fallout 4. This game is beginning to feel like more trouble then it's worth, like I'm being played by the fucking game, and not the other way around. The amount of eggshell walking I've subjected myself to to play this game properly is fucking unacceptable, and even brings my piss to a boil, as I think about it in retrospective. 

No service or product should ever do any of the shit I mentioned at all, especially when said service comes from companies like Bethesda and Sony, who are more then capable of doing better. 

I'm pretty burned out at this point, so I'm not going to waste my energy going further.

**Read more to understand what I'm trying to say. If you don't want to read the Cyberpunk part just look at the other bold text**

&amp;#x200B;

Minor and insignificant spoilers for the first 20 minutes of Cyberpunk and one quest

Cyberpunk was described as a RPG before its release. One of the most interesting features was the multiple intros (Street Kid, Nomad or Corpo) that would give you a unique beginning (quests, background) to the story, faction reputations based on your intro and just allow you to give your character a personality based on how they join the story. However, in Cyberpunk each character turns into the same one (Street Kid Merc) through a quick cutscene, even the Corpo, an office labourer (who is likely a bit of an asshole) caught up in the rat race of big business who is tasked to assassinate the boss of their boss. 

For the Corpo character, you get ready to plan your assassination, but then suddenly have your corporate status stripped from you and get introduced to the game properly, this is where that 20 minute cutscene comes in. I don't have a problem with you getting stripped of your corporate identity, this is a decent way to introduce the player into the main story of the game and set up an intriguing revenge, redemption or comeback plot. My only problem is that the game doesn't really do either of these things. You become a Street Kid Merc because the game wants you to be as it fits with all the best with most quests in the game. I would have preferred for the player to have been given a choice between what kind of affect this event has on their character.

For example, a disgraced Corpo could:

\- See this as an opportunity for themselves to be redeemed or atleast reborn, moving away from their avaricious past to become a mercenary who serves the people. Maybe this changes their morals, making them more of a harsh, inhospitable outlaw or a type of Robinhood, taking from corporations and giving back to the people. 

\- Seek revenge against those who harmed them. They could do this by becoming anti-establishment and destroying corporations, similar to the Robinhood idea but with much more anarchy. Alternatively, they could wish to seek revenge by climbing the corporate ladder again (legally or illegally) only to claim control of the business they were once fired from and deal punishment to those who stripped them of their lowly worker status. 

\- See this as punishment for failing to be a good worker and re-enter the vicious corporate world falling into perdition

But unfortunately, the game seems to want to force you into one role

**But, this got me thinking. What about something like this for Fallout?**

**Imagine starting as a tribal raider group, a cult follower, a rich brahmin baron, a brotherhood scribe, a Legion remanent, Enclave remanent, etc**

**Perhaps even Ghoul or Mutant intros could be an option**

**I like this idea because it is good for roleplaying and allows you to be introduced to the world in a way that doesn't mean you start off alone or in a small town and slowly expand outwards exploring different factions. You start with knowledge of the world and then expand, allowing you to make decisions based on what you already know. This would break up the formula Fallout games seem to fall into and also give great replay value. It would also mean that the intro the game won't be a boring thing you have to mod out / suffer through when you start up the game as shorter intro will be incentivized because producing 3+, 20 min - 1 hour long intros is hard. I would ideally like you to just be thrown into the first quest 5 minutes into the game, similar to New Vegas.**

The biggest praise I can give fallout 3 is that it really feels like a choices matter game, the choices for a lot of things are a bit more clear cut good vs bad, and the karma system makes it a lot more immersive since it changes the way certain characters see you. In Fallout 4 being evil and being good were meaningless and the choices weren't as numerous or clear cut. In Fallout 4 the most evil you could be is joining a gang of raiders. In 3 you can do a lot more evil things and experience actual consequences for them. I really really like that. If the ending wasn't so awful, I would play it  more than 4.",I beat fallout 3 today

362,Fallout,"I know why, buckle up kids prepare to learn some history and do some reading. The Chinese during the Final years of the Sino-American war 2074-2077  were pushed back on all fronts, in Alaska and in south east Asia (fo4 confirms this), The Chinese mainland was now under direct threat of American invasion and it was. American forces invaded east central china in 2074. the Yangtze became a warzone, a warzone that became a stalemate, The stalemate became broken after The us army field tested its Superior T51 power armor for the first time. Chinese supply lines from the nations it annexed started to break down The us took advantage and started to invade the strategically vital city’s of shanghai and Nanjing with the loss of major citys/provinces military resources began to become scarce .  In the gobi desert things were not looking good for the Chinese either, military bases were being overrun and they were loosing soldiers at a record  number (Thanks to the help of T51 units ripping through Chinese battalions) And American forces fighting all throughout china slowly creeping their way towards The capital, the fall of Beijing looked imminent. The Chinese were desperate they did not need to win the war they just needed to bring the Americans to the negotiating table. My theory is that CHINESE INTELLIGENCE came up with the IDEA OF A SMALL SCALE INVASION OF THE EASTERN SEABOARD ALTHOUGH MORE PREDOMINANTLY FOCUSED ON THE D.C AREA enough to scare the Us to negotiate , OK HEAR ME OUT  in fallout 3 we constantly come across Chinese officer swords,pistols and assault rifles that are being used by wastelanders 200 years after the bombs fell that just should show how prepared those bastards were and the sheer amount of hardware they brought .  on top of that we come across the Chinese remnants of mama dolces and a few other commandos and Agents across the wasteland , you could be asking  they might not have the numbers for an invasion nope that’s were ur wrong, its actually a silver lining. The American populace during the Sino American war were tired of the food shortages, the government and the loss of life they were ready for something new, hell Wasn’t martial law established ? Didn’t riots happen due to the government’s neglect and abuse its safe to say that some people in America started to embrace communism and would be willing to uprise against the feds. Thats were the Chinese agents/commandos come in they came into America under the fase alias of being workers or whatnot (like in mama dolces)  and they would start training communist sympathizers to build a Militia to overthrow the government hence why there are so many fucking Chinese named weapons in the capitol wasteland, it wasn’t exactly for the the agents it was for the home grown commie militia. Even the communist radio America broadcast in fallout 3 is targeted towards Americans to show them that that their war was unjust and that the wall street gang was lining their pockets specifically trying to have them change sides. Lets go to the appliachia in 76 you will see the liberators (small Chinese robots) all over the wasteland on them are what? Propaganda flyers made to change the hearts and minds of American citizens and in the deep there is a Chinese base inside the base there is a terminal in the terminal it says “operation piercing viper has commenced” or something like that I believe operation piercing viper might be the code name for this plan. I’ll wrap it up now in a nice little bow I believe that the Chinese at the end of the war were desperate to not loose. using The american populaces uneasiness towards the federal government the Chinese came up with a plan to inspire Americans to change their worldview while using commandos to infiltrate inside the united states to Form, Arm(again the abundance of Chinese weapons in fo3) , and strengthen an underground military force to rebel against the us government. Similar to how the us uses special forces to do the exact same thing in our real world.

390,Fallout,"While the nature of the Stranger is, of course, a mystery, I think I have a reasonably compelling argument to shine some light on who he is, and more importantly, who he works for. 

We do not know if the Stranger is a person, or just a title. However, this theory works in either scenario.

First, we have to ask ourselves, what do we know of the Stranger; what are his attributes?

1) He appears when we use V.A.T.S with our Pip-Boy, and vanishes just as quickly

2) He wears a Fedora, and a Trench Coat

3) He helps out the player, regardless of their reputation with any faction or their Karma

&amp;#x200B;

Since he only appears if we are using V.A.T.S, we can assume that the activation of VATS causes him to know our location, and that we are in danger. VATS is Pip-Boy technology, and who designed Pip-Boys? Vault-Tec. Presumably, he has access to very advanced technology as he can teleport to our position, then teleport away.

Next, we know he wears a fedora and trench coat. What other character wears this outfit? The *Vault-Tec* representative who visits the player of Fallout 4 before the bombs hit. 

We know he is not affiliated with any other faction, because he doesn't care if all the other factions hate us, so that means he is either a neutral entity, or working for a different faction, somewhere out there in the wastes.

My theory is that the Stranger is being employed by a Post-War Vault-Tec, to manipulate events from behind the scenes and ensure certain historical figures who use VATS are allowed to complete their adventures. There are other factions, such as the Talon Company Mercs, who seem to be getting all their funding and supplies from some unknown source...as if they too were being employed by this same, shady company?

What is Post-War Vault Tec doing? I don't know for sure,, but the pieces seem to fit.","My ""Mysterious Stranger"" theory - who is he, and who does he work for?"

Most of the essential info is in the image, but most of it is a very rough outline. Essentially it'd be a pretty large map with a clear distinction between civilised land and factions vs wild land and factions. The wild land would be very survival heavy. Vehicles (boats would be especially handy) and ridable animals could be a great way to make travel fast and interesting. Those who do not like this can still fast travel of course. There are no faction names yet, so I'll refer to factions by their main settlement or their lifestyle. Obv the map wouldnt be 1:1 to real life, but still very large.  


**General things about the setting:** Most communities and settlements are only armed with small arms. This lack of heavy weapons is the reason for walls becoming a viable defensive structure for settlements. Not only do they protect settlements from hostile people, but also from mutated wildlife smelling easy snacks behind the walls.  


Trade caravans are much more protected in civilized land than in other Fallout titles. They may carry more advanced goods, but robbing them will be especially difficult in the early game.   


Wild areas, even non-irradiated ones, will feature a far greater focus on survival than other FO-titles. Players should think carefully what they do with their limited inventory space, if they plan on heading into these areas, or have to due to quests. Rare loot, abandoned military bases, raider outposts and hidden settlements should break up the regrowth of nature over the fields from time to time.   


**About side-quests:** Faction related side quests should make the final battle easier or harder, depending on which faction you do these quests for and which one you side with in the main quest line. For example: If you're negotiating an arms trade deal as a high charisma character for the St Louis faction, and later choose to side with the Lord of Springfield, it should make your battle harder, because your enemy will have better guns. On the other hand, leading an expedition against the raiders while siding with St Louis could make your side have more people in the final battle, since you just freed up a great amount of forces that were tied down with trade protection.  


Non-faction/minor faction related side quests should have little influence on the main quest line. They should be immediately rewarding, rather than having an effect later on.  


**Possible Faction Backstories:**   


**Nomadic Raiders and River Pirates:** Before they turned to raiding, the nomads tried to establish their own farming communities. After being left near-starving following repeated drought years, they began wandering in search of a new home. During their journey they found a caravan escorted by a group of riders. The nomads in their desperation attacked this caravan, after having their pleas for food refused, and seized everything from weapons to animals to food. After this success they slowly drifted into a lifestyle of raiding everything they could.However internal distrust quickly grew among them and a group of exiles set themselves up in Quincy(might need to be renamed to due identical name in FO4), where they found a few old boats anchored riverside. They repaired what they could and started a career of piracy on the Mississippi.  


**St. Louis Faction:** After repeated attacks on their river shipping by aforementioned pirates, a group of semi wealthy traders set came together in the ruins of St. Louis to start an alliance to defend themselves against the pirates. Growing closer and closer together, they began to form their own government, in which the traders looked out for each other, but not necessarily for the people in their territories. Becoming a stabilising factors in the region meant it become wealthy, which in turn meant they became an important destination for other traders in along the Mississippi.  


**The feudal state in Springfield**: Springfield being a relatively lucky city, having not been directly hit during the Great War, still faced severe problems in the immediate aftermath. The Fallout from the warheads that hit St-Louis still heavily decimated its population and the population surrounding it. During this time, the chief of Springfields police, who survived the Fallout, organised a militia out of the policemen who were lucky enough not to die from the Fallout. Declaring himself the Lord of Springfield, he and his men started to impose their own order on the local population, disregarding most ideas of state from the pre-war era. After having established themselves as a local power, they approached settlements in the immediate vicinity of Springfield with offers to either join them or be conquered. Those who joined them still retained a relatively large degree of autonomy, being able to organise their territories however they wanted to, so long as they paid tribute to the Lord. Due to the spread out nature of the settlements under the Lord, they were allowed to retain their own militias, but also had to contribute a few soldiers for the Lord's army every few years. While the Lord has passed long ago, his state has survived so far and his more benevolent descendants have taken the reigns.  


**Ghoul Tribes:** Despite living among humans for quite some time, distrust between them and humans reached a tipping point, after a local ghoul gang made the streets of St Louis unsafe. One of St Louis' most important traders seized this as an opportunity to gain a large political following, which he used in an election year to quickly intimidate his political opponents into retreating from the stage. Through this, he managed to win the election and made good on his promise to 'take revenge' on ALL ghouls inside the walls of St Louis, expelling most of them, except those who were on this man's good side before the ghoul gang incidents. After being expelled from the city, the ghouls quickly dispersed into many small communities to the east of the city, hoping to be let back in one day.   


**The start of the territorial conflict between St Louis and Springfield:** A few of the current Lord's subjects felt the tributes to be too humiliating to continue any longer. In their dissatisfaction, they secretly began negotiations to join the traders of St. Louis, who promised them much greater respect and great autonomy to them, while demanding to be granted exclusive trade rights on the Illinois river. After a promise of being backed up by the traders, the Lord's subjects on the river declared secession from their Lord. Not knowing what awaited them, the Lord only sent a small force to restore order. This small force had quickly been crushed by the combined troops of the former subjects and the mercenaries employed by the traders.

Typically in the animal kingdom, tails do one of two things:

For balance, like with... I dunno, some of the big dinosaurs (I'm not an animal scientist, don't hate me).

It strikes me that Deathclaw tails can't do the gripping thing, so they must do the Dino balancing thing.

If this is correct, then logic dictates that if you shoot for their tail, the should fall over or something, right?

399,Fallout,"Alright I've been thinking and this was probably obvious and I'm just oblivious to finding a post to it but if it's already been talked about tell me so I can delete this. So recently I watched a fallout iceberg video and in the comment section I saw someone make a theory about the god like beings dunwich came across, it wasn't that good of a theory he made but it made something click in my head(probably a theory just as bad), what if the zetans were looking for the those godly creatures that dunwich was looking for. What if those other worldly eldritch creatures are enemies of the zetans and present a major threat to the zetan race so they feel the need to find them and eliminate them. The other worldly creatures I'm referring to are the ones you find in dunwich buildings and the interloper creatures found in fallout 76. I noticed that zetans tend to be in the regions that contain statues and eldritch themed creatures, like what if the flatswoods monsters are zetan scouts trying to look for the location of the dormant interloper so they can destroy it when it's most vulnerable and weak. As far as I know the interloper is the only large actual organism in the Fallout games you can physically find other than statues so like what if there's all this constant zetans scouting west virginia just for the 2 interloper creatures that are living there. What if all the eldritch entities come from the same face of supernatural aliens that can cause people to hallucinate and make them slaves by invoking fear for them to pray causing an illusion that they're godly entities such as what happens with the cultists, each time we see these creatures they cause some form of hallucination except the one in 76 because it's dormant maybe it was attacked and put to near death and feeds off the prayers by the cultist. Basically what if the zetans killed a bunch of these creatures and weakened so many in some really long war on some planet that the remainder of them fled to earth in hopes of feeding of the fooled that they made fear them with the hallucination like power that they have. This theory is pretty bad but I just felt like sharing, what do you think, what would make this theory better or should I just not ever say any of this again.",Fallout theory: zetans are trying to search and destroy the eldritch gods

402,Fallout,"Good Afternoon,  

So, ever since I played Fallout 4 I have been wondering about this. At the time the game takes place the NCR and East Coast BoS chapter are both allies (this is supported by the fact that Maxon has had contact with the East Coast Chapter.) Since both the NCR and BOS are massive in size now, would the two eventually clash over territory in a few hundred years? I imagine that since the NCR is always expanding and looking for new territory, and the BoS try to civilize most areas I wouldn't say it's impossible to see them meeting somewhere in the middle. Also while we're on the topic of massive factions in the wasteland, what is the mid-west chapter doing now? From what I understand they were cast away after a disagreement with the East Coast but they still control hundreds of miles of territory.

When 76 was announced I was beyond hyped. An online fallout game I could play with my friends sounded like everything I'd ever dreamed of as a kid. Then, it finally came out and was absolute trash. Quests didn't work, leveling didn't work, combat didn't work, building didn't work, just the whole thing was fucked. Me and my friends tried getting into it, but it was just too buggy and broken so we moved on to other games. When the wastelanders update launched a while later I'd begun seeing people saying the game had become much better so me and one of my friends tried to give it another chance. The first new quest we tried was broken so we again abandoned the game. I was wondering if things have improved in any way since then or if we were possibly too quick to dismiss the game on the second try. I really wanted to enjoy this game and so did all of my friends, but it just fell so short at launch that I'm sure most of them wouldn't consider returning.

To start, after fixing the walls and setting up the standard turrets around the wall I decided a bunch of lasers wasn’t the most fun way to defend the throne of my empire. I built a few mirelurk cages on the far side and then a deathclaw cage on the side with the door. After that I decided to wall in the door so no synths could get in unless they teleported. With a bunch of empty space inter door I filled it with flamethrowers, turrets, and moving sawblades so that my inner Macaulay Culkin would be pleased. With all of the preparations completed I decided to let them throw themselves at my mayhem. The first two waves ran into the murder room and lasted a solid second-and-a-half before being chopped, burned, and riddled with lead. Then the third wave hit. I decided it was time to unleash the kraken and opened up my cages. As I ran along the wall two glowing mirelurk hunters and a mirelurk deep king demolished one side while my chameleon deathclaw “sneakily” tore the others to shreds. By the time they were done with the synth bastards the final wave was teleported inside the castle walls getting torn apart by Dance, Strong, piper, Preston, Mcready, and my man valentine. As I stood on the walls sniping who I could I turned around to realize I had Godzilla vs King Ghidorah as the deathclaw and Mirelurk king were fighting to prove who would be my champion.

422,Fallout,"My first experience in Dead Money was on a pure guns character, which made combat an extremely tedious slog. I thought going in on a melee weapons character might let me judge it more fairly, because a lot of my hatred for the DLC was tied to how tedious and repetitive combat was. Playing melee definitely expedited the combat, but I still didn't find anything to enjoy about it. Rant about why I hate this DLC below.

Dead money is by far the most visually and mechanically bland DLC for me. Aesthetically, there is just nothing there. It's an endless series of identical grey corridors you are forced to progress through in a linear fashion. Gameplay wise, it is very different from anything else in the game, but different doesn't mean better or interesting. It's only different in the fact that it removes all the variety in enemies and weapons and makes you fight the same copy/paste enemy with the same boring, unsatisfying weapons for the length of the entire DLC. As a guns character, you are given two guns, and neither of them feel like they have any feedback, and you have to shoot a limb over and over and over waiting for it to randomly explode. It's the most mind numbingly boring, tedious combat experience I've ever had in New Vegas. As a melee weapons character, combat is totally trivialized. Just special attack with the knife spear to knock them down and spam left click. That's all you have to do here entire DLC. It's not fun, but at least its over quickly. Haven't tried energy weapons, but there's no way I'm subjecting myself to this DLC a third time. I would be totally fine with the DLC taking all my weapons away if it had anything good to replace them with, but all the weapons in this DLC are incredibly unsatisfying. Maybe part of that feeling is due to the lack of enemy variety, but it's not a good experience either way. 

Beyond combat, all the other mechanics also seem designed, not really to challenge you in any way, but to waste as much of your time as possible. The radios are not a challenge. They just make you walk in and out of rooms looking for them. They needlessly slow you down. The fog doesn't really present a threat. It just forces you to spend 30 seconds holding E on a sink after going through it, maximizing the amount of time you need to subject your eyes to the aforementioned identical grey corridors. 

Speaking of which, I never got this ""intense survival horror"" vibe people sometimes attribute to this DLC, and I play on Very Hard in Hardcore mode. I'm not going to tell people to ""git gud"". It could be some of them just aren't abusing mechanics the way I did, and I'm glad if they got that experience. Scrounging for resources in the first 15 minutes was genuinely fun for me. Switching to my fists to kill a radroach without wasting durability on the pipe I found was fun. Of course, you'll have literally more weapons than you can carry after that, because most ghost people carry like 6 of them. Health isn't really an issue because there are sinks everywhere with a 5-1 HP-Rad ratio, which is essentially unlimited healing, and once you find the code to turn chips into stimpacks, you'll have more healing than you'll ever need. I never spent chips on anything other than stims, because everything else was kind of useless, and I left the DLC with 180 stimpacks on the hardest difficulty. That doesn't really feel like a resource crunch to me. 

And then at the end of the DLC, it tries to tie its themes together with the gold bars, which would be a neat idea if the confrontation with Elijah wasn't so poorly done. Even with 100 stealth and a stealth boy active, he will immediately detect you if you so much as caps walk within 15 feet of him, even if his back is turned. He will pivot instantly to face you. It feels like its hard coded and has nothing to do with your actual stealth. That's reinforced by the fact that he automatically detects you if you get close to either door, even if all the same conditions apply and he's across the room or not even in the room yet. Except for one of the doors during one part of his scripted walk sequence. What a lazy way to do a ""stealth"" sequence. And even then, there's multiple ways to get out with all the gold, which sort of undermines the theme, but that really doesn't matter because the theme was already undermined. If you have any decent amount of luck, you can easily walk out of the casino with 15k pre war money. A 1-1 exchange rate between Sierra madre chips and stacks of pre war money is just ridiculous, but apparently that's what they went with, so by the time you actually get to the vault, the gold bars are essentially worthless to you. I only took them with out of spite for the DLC thinking it had earned the right to have themes at the end of the slog that it put me through.

445,Fallout,"As you know they did say at E3 that they want to eventually add Modding Capabilities to 76. I believe the way they should implement it is by making it where they should make private servers free like they originally intended but keep Fallout 1st as like a premium thing, for example, private servers could be free to everyone for modding your game but if you want to pay for a premium where you get scrap boxes, monthly exclusive items, and monthly free atoms, then you can. They should make private servers free so people can mod them as they wish, new weapons, new armors, adding new quests and new worlds. They should also add modding capabilities to public servers but extremely limited. Mods like retextures and maybe some animation mods that change things in certain ways. It would work just like skyrim together, you can use certain mods on public servers that modify textures and animation as long as it doesn't modify things like weapon damage, armor resistance, etc. Since the mods downloaded are retextures and don't modify stats in any way only other people with the same mods can see them. For example: If someone ported Vivid Fallout to fallout 76 and was using it on a public server, only said person's game will look different, to other people who don't have vivid fallout installed, it will look normal. If they ported right handed Handmade Rifle animations to 76, only said person and others with the same mod downloaded will see the animation change, but others without the animation mod will see the normal animation.

Since we've seen so many interesting vault experiments in the series, it makes me wonder if Bethesda (or possibly Obsidian) will delve into vaults with different ideologies. It might sound like a bland idea when you can just apply differing ideologies to the factions present throughout the game, but imagine something like a vault experiment being to have a self-contained authoritarian democracy. While this experiment was originally intended to be contained to the vault alone, over the years the elected overseer decided to enter the wasteland and spread their ""empire"" throughout the area.

It is incredible how mods can change the feel of the game and how much you can make it fun for yourself, it has infinite possibilities, from making it a Hardcore Survival game, to a complete horror experience, a tactical modern shooter or even a full zombie game.

And the graphics/weather/texture mods, they are truly a wonder, completing F4 on a map full of snow felt amazing.

And the small quirky dumb mods like the laser guns sound replacer that makes every gun sound like *pew* or the thomas the train classic mod just make me want to play more and more.

And as a OG XOne player, i truly appreciate all the performance patches and fps fixes, specially around Diamond city because Vanilla just straight goes 15-20 fps when just walking around the city, and with all the patches and stuff it goes up to solid 30 fps (which is fine to me) and 40-50 fps anywhere else (with fps unlocker) 

And i can’t even imagine how good mods gotta be on PC, i just hope one day i can build myself a great PC to fill Fallout 4 with +200 mods and spend the rest of my free time playing haha.","Fallout 4 is good, but Fallout 4 modded is the best game ever."

460,Fallout,"I have never come to this sub as I usually stick to subs for specific game series entries but I noticed there is almost an entire split decision on the opinions of Fallout 4 here. Personally Fallout 4 is my favourite Fallout game, yes I know probably weird to a lot of people, to me though it is the obvious choice.   


Sure, Fallout 4 has some moments or things that I would change, but so do all of the other Fallout games. In terms of how it plays, the general setting, flow, feeling and how it sucks you in has never been an issue to me and has provided me with the most hours of enjoyment out of all Fallout games. I'm honestly really surprised to see the amount of hate it gets, it honestly is not as bad as a lot of the comments make it seem.    


A lot of the hate I see for Fallout 4 definitely feels like some weird cult like circle jerk hate over petty issues that honestly aren't as bad as previous titles. Like I said, every Fallout game has issues or things that could be fixed and tweaked, why is it such a massive problem in 4? It really feels like old fuddy-duddies complaining about change or how it isn't basically a like for like copy of how NV feels and plays.",Honestly where does everyone stand on Fallout 4?

Caesar main goal is to combine the ncr and the legion together by getting rid of the ncr counsel and making a military dictatorship and with all the citizens and infrastructure create a power empire.

467,Fallout,"One of my favorite experiences in any open world game is getting to a location I can’t fast travel to. The simple getting from point A to point B makes even mundane tasks interesting. As the player progresses from early to mid game, fast travel becomes more widely used. Fast travel is convenient and does reduce grind. Fast travel is all well and good, but it decreases the amount of interaction the player has with the game world. To put it simply, the strength of a open world game should be in the player’s interaction with the world. But you can have your cake and eat it to, via a fast travel system similar to that seen in The Witcher 3. 

In The Witcher 3 fast travel is based on a series of location throughout the game world. These fast travel locations are common enough that they are convenient, but spread out enough that they don’t completely remove non-fast travel. 

It’s a little mechanic that I think would add a lot of depth to the gameplay.","Location based fast travel, as seen in The Witcher 3’s signposts, is a smart update of isometric Fallout’s exit grid system, and would be a great addition to the next entry in the series."

498,Fallout,"Anyone else bothered by the way certain apparel that was good Fallout 3, isn't very good in New Vegas. First of all, the Chinese Stealth Armor is pretty much useless now as it doesn't have the Stealth Field that it had in Fallout 3. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was pretty OP, but it was locked behind a relatively difficult DLC, and had a very poor condition level, meaning it was only really useful if you wanted to sneak around without engaging in combat. They could've at least made the Chinese Stealth Armor much harder to obtain to compensate for it's over-poweredness, or lock the Stealth Field behind a Perk or something.

And now we move onto the Merc Outfits, which were pretty good in Fallout 3 for how much DR they gave combined with how easy they were to obtain early on. They had 12 DR by the way, which, judging how DR translates to DT in New Vegas, you'd think the Merc Outfits would have at least 7 DT right? But no, they made it 1 DT. Why? I'm guessing people will defend it and say that this makes it more realistic. Well, I don't see what's so realistic about Joshua Graham's Armor having a DT of 15 despite just being a collared formal shirt underneath a SWAT Tactical Vest, or those god-awful rags and Ugg Boots Veronica wears having a DT of 6.",Fallout New Vegas nerfed certain apparel
499,Fallout,"Today I noticed that my game look sensitivity and all of my display settings, for example dialogue subtitles and pip boy colors reset after I restart the game which is annoying.

 I have read all of the discussions about this problem and about how you should turn off the read only from the ini files and turn it back on after you have changed your settings but it didn't work for me. I have also checked that my firewall is not blocking the game from accessing and modifying files. 

So now I have started to suspect if this has something to do with Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) which I use to install my mods, when I first installed MO2 it said something about clearing the read only flag from the ini files which I chose. Mod organizer 2 offered to also ""write to ini once"" but I don't think that would help since I did the same thing but just manually by setting the ini's off of read only and changed the settings and then changed the ini's to read only again which didn't work for me. So should I do something about MO2, and if so what?

I don't see that many people complaining about this problem anymore so I wonder if they got it fixed somehow.

1. .The Prydwen wreckage proves to be very valuable to the Minutemen, as tons of building materials is scavenged from the scrap that was once the Brotherhood of Steel's Mobile Command Center. Any weapons, armor and even Power Armor that survived the explosion is repaired and used by the Minutemen.
2. After being ousted as a Synth, Mayor McDonough is publicly executed in defiance of the now former Institute. It is decided that Diamond City will no longer have a Mayor, but is instead run by a City Council. Nick, Piper, Arturo, Travis, Moe, Dr. Sun and Danny are given chairs on the Council and run the City as equals.
3. The reformation of the Commonwealth Provisional Government is once again brought up and The Minutemen, Diamond City and Goodneighbor are the first to join it, with several other Settlements in The Commonwealth join soon after and soon become a major force on the East, similar to the NCR in the West. The General was elected the first President of the NCPG and served for many years.
4. Synth Shaun continues to live alongside his mother/father, tinkering, inventing and improving various machines and gizmos he finds around his home. 
5. The Raiders of Nuka World were no match for The General and their Minutemen. With Mags, William, Mason, Lizzie, Nisha, Dixie and Savoy dead, the leaderless Raiders who survived The Minutemen's attack fled into the wastes, to either join new gangs or had simply died. Nuka World became a major City and Trading Hub within the New Commonwealth Provisional Government. (NCPG for short)
6. After helping out the Residents of Far Harbor, Acadia and the surrounding Settlements, they agree to join the NCPG and they begin installing more Fog Condensers on the Island, almost permanently extinguishing the Fog. 
7. After gaining enough power, the NCPG and the Gunners wage a long war and Quincy is eventually retaken by The Minutemen. The Gunners end up being a shadow of the former selves and are faded from memory while taking various low paying jobs.
8. Although trapped on the roof of a tall Skyscraper, Ironsides remained hopeful he and was eventually able to start up the boosters once again, only for them to dislodge from the ship and take out two surrounding buildings. Remaining hopeful, Ironsides only claimed that this was just ""another setback"".
9. Brian Virgil continued his work on his FEV Cure and through many trials and errors, his formula was mostly generalized. In the dead of night and hidden from sight, Virgil would load his cure in a Syringer and shoot Brahmin with it to help his cure spread faster in the Wasteland. He only prayed that this would make up for his past work in the Institute's FEV Labs.
10. Codsworth continued to proudly serve his master, until they passed away in their sleep at an old age. He mourned for a time and then began to serve Synth Shaun, who mainly requested Codworth to collect parts for him, which he happily obliged. Codsworth would soon learn even he wasn't safe from the eccentric Synth Child's need to ""upgrade"" things and some some Wastelanders now speak of a Robot with Giddyup Buttercup Heads as ""eyes"".  Despite this, Codworth was happy to serve and though he didn't really mean it, he told Synth Shaun that he ""liked"" his ""upgrades"".
11. With his son cured of his disease, MacCready refunds the Caps the Sole Survivor had paid him and they part ways, returning to the Capital Wasteland, to once again take Mercenary work, the only life he knows.
12. Paladin Danse would eventually return to the Boston Airport, knowing what had happened and who was responsible. He mourned the deaths of his former friends and wandered into the wastes, never to be seen again.
13. Preston Garvey proudly served The Minutemen for the rest of his life. He was always ready to help someone in need at a minute's notice.
14. Piper had a lot of fun telling people ""I told you so"" after she was proven right about McDonough being a Synth. She continued watching over Nat, writing her Paper and making decisions on the City Council.
15. With the death of Eddie Winter, Nick was finally able to find peace with himself, finally avenging the Nick Valentine that died so long ago. His Detective Agency remained open, taking one case at a time. 
16. X6-88 became troubled over the loss of The Institute and while he attempted to settle into a new life, he was unable to cope with what had happened to The Institute. One day, the burden became too much for him and he took up his Laser Rife and went on a suicide mission to kill the one who ruined his life and in his words ""doomed humanity forever"". Father's Father made short work of X6's attempts at vengeance and he is now buried in an unmarked grave behind one of the old Sanctuary Houses.
17. Hancock continued his life as Mayor of Goodneighbor while helping out the weak. While never officially joining The Minutemen, he became a good friend and ally to them. Anyone in Goodneighbor caught picking on the weak and defenseless would always wind up dead in a dumpster.
18. Curie continued her research and with her new Synth Body and Mind, the sky was the limit. She would go on to publish many books of many subjects ranging from Science, Medicine and everything else she could think of. Her books became immensely popular and would be considered superior to The Wasteland Survival Guide.
19. Deacon was happy to know the oppression of Synths was finally over and like many times before, changed his face and identity, becoming a spy for hire.
20. A loyal Hound to the end, Dogmeat remained at the Sole Survivor's side until he became a very old dog. When he passed, his grave was located at the place he and his master had met, the Red Rocket Station near Sanctuary.
21. Finally understanding the Milk of Human Kindness, Strong attempted to sway his brethren to follow in his footsteps. This would often end up with Strong killing the other Super Mutants in blind rage after they made fun of him. Not wanting to be weak, Strong still continued to try to teach his brethren about the Milk of Human Kindness, with little to no success.

-compelling story
-fantastic atmosphere
-interesting characters
-rpg/planning your character/depth

-30 hours in and no mount or speed upgrade to movement. Maybe this is coming later in game? 

-only being able to place 1 marker and not knowing what you've completed, im sure mods could easily fix this but im on console. As a completionist this is a nuisance.

-companions randomly killing enemies without my command (they're not on aggressive) ruining the immersion 

- have been stuck ~6 times in only 30 hours of gameplay and believe me, i dont check every nook in cranny, because:

-not EVERYTHING is explorable. So many boarded up buildings or houses i waste time walking up to.

520,Fallout,"Which part of the fallout timeline would you like to set the next fallout. Not what location as that is asked all the time. I have two that I love would to see in future games.

The first is directly after the Great War. We know it was possible to save during that time from 76 and it would be interesting see how the prewar society fell into chaos. Would likely have to add a new roster of creatures to the game because the staple ones would be extremely rarely or haven’t been created yet in the timeline. 

Second would be a game post 3/4. The ending of 3 would lead to the wasteland getting a little more stable around DC and we could see more groups trying to do more than just survive like we see more on the west coast titles.

536,Fallout,how do you get/downlod mods for fnv i am on x-box 360 if that helps,mods for fallout new vegas
537,Fallout,"MINOR SPOILERS FOR 3, NV, AND 4. but frankly if you haven't played them by now it's your fault.

Also, this post isn't to take away from your opinion on how you want your next Fallout game. This is just so people can get an idea of how bad writing can make good writing seem like other things.

I've seen it on a lot of fallout threads that factions in Fallout 4 were bad and that a lot of people preferred FNV over other games in part because the major factions were not good or bad. But all kind of morally darker gray.

I'm here to say that the factions weren't better because they were gray, they were better because they were better written and more fleshed out.

FO3 has this same issue, while some people like it more, it's generally agreed that the main story is kind of... Boring. It's not much of a choice. Save everyone or kill everyone? 

FNV was written very well. The NCR were very clearly closer to a lighter gray, but we're often morally objectionable. Levying high taxes on poor towns, acting as saviors when it was the Courier who did the saying, trying to take power and water for themselves at others expense, etc.  Then the legion were very clearly on the bad side but weren't always just evil. Their leader was smart, he knew rebuilding the old west wouldn't work and that people needed order. He honestly wanted to help and you could tell that even if his actions of slavery and crucifixion are deplorable. Then the others were gray and when you realized there were no objectively good choices, you could fall back to YesMan. Like I accidently did my first time.

In 4, the Railroad and Minute Men were so obviously good that they were one dimensional. This could have been fine if the storyline wasnt so bland and the other factions made up for it. But it wasn't and they didn't. Then the institute is very clearly the ""more bad"" faction. They stole people and didn't consider conscious, sentient beings alive. BUT Bethesda tried to make you feel like maybe they weren't so bad because they had *technology* and your son  running the place. Then the BOS was also more bad but not really bad. Yes, they hated non-ferals and synths but you never got the feeling they were one step away from holocausting the commonwealth or one step towards being convinced to save everyone. They were very standalone but not enough that it felt like they were a good fallback.

In NV, the writers brought everyone down a moral peg and combined that with good writing to make them feel authentic. In 4, they seemed to try to bring everyone up a bit. Combine a new bright color palette with bright eyed factions instead of surviving warring factions. Even in 3, the writing was good. Yes they were one dimensional but they had a reason to be. It was literally life  or death for the Capitol. Each vying for life.

These other games have made a lot of people think they want morally gray factions that are ""realistic"" about life in Fallout (I.e. look out for yourself and fuck everyone else). But that's the wrong connection. Having a game like that isn't pleasant to play unless it's the punch in the gut during the last mission, similar to Shadow of the Colossus. But Fallout isn't that type of game. No one plays fallout to have it feel sour constantly. Your actions have consequences and not everything will likely be okay.  

NV did this but it was mission to mission. You rescued Primm but the radio after makes it sound like a dictator just moved in. Sour. You moved the Powder Gang out of Good springs and saved what's his nuts. Not sour. Then, at the end you can get a good ending, it's not all good, but that's what makes it fun. You can go back and try again because it might be good but it might not be the best. The other games made you feel like you'd won if you sided with the good guys and lost with the bad guys whereas NV made you feel like you'd won no matter what. 

Now all this sounds like I'm contradicting myself, but I'm not. Fallout NV (and 3 but less so) made the bad guys feel real and honest, not just plain evil or boring. And the good guys still wanted to help even if they weren't always perfect. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO BE TWO SIDES OF A DARK SHITTY COIN.

Plenty of wonderful, fun games have BBEGs make good points and have the good guys do some shitty things. And some even have a clear line between the two but it's still fun and immersive. 

So no, you don't want factions dark, gritty, edgy, and morally objectionable. You want them written well so you can get invested into their cause and feel like they're real.","No, you don't want factions to be morally darker gray, you just want them better written."
538,Fallout,"Where and when would you like Fallout 5 to take place? 

Personally I don't want to go much further than 4 has considering that Fallout is starting to get to that ""rebuilding"" phase and less Post-Apocalypse. I'd like to maybe see a game set sometime within the range of 1 - 3 and take place up near the great lakes regions. 

There were plenty of cities that were on the up and up in the 50's, namely Detroit, Cleveland and Columbus and each of these cities have rich histories. I think you could make for some really compelling games. 

If they were to do something like Detroit, you could do some unique story lines what with Canada being across the lake there.

550,Fallout,"I know that Bethesda is busy with Fallout 5 (along with Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield), plus they're stilling updating Fallout 76, so the chance of another spinoff game coming anytime soon is slim.  That doesn't stop us fans from discussing ideas of possible spinoffs, however.  
  
One idea that's being bouncing around in my head for the past few days is a pre-war action game set in China where you are a US soldier or secret agent set ahead of the main invasion force.  Your mission: to disable China's first strike capabilities and nuclear arsenal.  This could be a Metal Gear-esque stealth game, or it could be just a straight up action shooter.  This could be play out where you fail to complete your mission and you have a front-row seat to TEOTWAKI as Chinese missiles are launched, or it could end up as an alternate universe thing where you complete your mission and the ending cutscene has US Soldiers marching down a Beijing street, with Liberty Prime leading the way.

565,Fallout,"What kind of changes you would make? Let's pretend, that you are a superior modder, or a dev., and wish to expand the main story, and it's ending with more choices, and functions. What kind of options would you put in? Here are mine:

Institute surrender (all faction except institute): at the end when you reach the generator the Institute would offer surrender. Spare them, and their technology, and they will be under your service, and supervision. Different faction leaders require different charisma check to accept it. Preston wouldn't need any, because you are the boss. Desdemona would require a large one, because she absolutely hates the Institute, and has little care for their technology. Maxxon would require medium. While he also despise the Institute he does not deny that their technology is impressive, and useful.

Railroad alternative takeover: this one would require some convincing, but you could give an alternative path for the Railroad to take over the Institute. With much less bloodshed. What you need is to sneak, and hack into the Synth Retention Bureau's office, and find the shutdown codes for the Institute's defenses. Then you need to convince everyone to leave the teleporter, and bring the Railroad agents in. Then you go to the Director's office, and send out the shutdown signal, and order everyone to let the Railroad take over. The RR goes in, and with the defenses down almost all members of the Institute surrenders without fight. You get informed, that a several scientists went back to the reactor room, and must pursue before they do something stupid. In the reactor room they threaten you with blowing up everything, if you, and the RR don't leave forever. You have 5 option there.

1. Before the dialogue happens you could use stealth boy to sneak in, and sabotage the controls. Preventing the ability to give the command.
2. You could use a very high charisma check to have them stand down.
3. Speaking with Tinker Tom would reveal, that he has a stealth boy, and if you distract them, then he can sabotage the controls for you. Need low charisma check for the distraction dialogues.
4. Speaking with Desdemona would offer to take reverse roles. She makes a distraction while you sneak for the controls. Reduce perception of enemies during the talking. She would also give you a stealth boy.
5. You can fight without sabotage. You get exactly 1 second before the guy at the controls press the button, and game over. So you need to be very fast, use vats, or start killing that guy instead of the dialogue. Also during the dialogue you would have an option to shoot that person straight away. Be warned, that if not sabotaged, then multiple NPC would be scripted to run there, and press the button. YOU MUST NOT ALLOW THEM.

Kellog's deal. During your encounter with Kellog you could make a deal. He brings you into the Institute, and you help him with Virgil. He becomes a temporary companion. Once Virgil down he honor his end of the deal, and gives you his device with the courser chip, and gives the command of his recall. You enter the Institute instead of him, and stuff gets revealed. You never meet Kellog again. Later you can learn that he left the Commonwealth. Probably for good.",If you could alter F4's main story as you see fit.
566,Fallout,"Since Fallout 1, there has never been a connected story or a sequel from one game to another. Just a different location and a couple of references to the previous fallout games. So this may be a pipe dream of mine.

I'd imagine a Commonwealth set 60-70 years after the destruction of the Institute and the Invasion of  Splinter Cell Group of the Brotherhood Of Steel (Like the Outcasts?)

The Sole Survivor who sided with the Minutemen rebuilt the City Boston, where Diamond City is really the 'Jewel Of the Commonwealth' the hub for Science and Technology as the Remnants of the Institute ran here and became pioneers for research and technology, Goodneighbour which is still a sanctuary for the Ghouls and the underbelly of society and surrounding Massachusetts is littered with Minutemen settlements and Raiders, Super Mutants and Ghouls have been relatively cleansed. The Railroad is still underground helping the remaining Synths on the run and working with them. The Brotherhood who maintains a small Garrison/Embassy at the Airport still gathers prewar tech in the Glowing Sea and is in amicable relations with the Minutemen. Everything is well until the Death of Elder Maxson.

Civil War entails following his death and a group known as the BOS Outcasts had taken over, the Outcasts who continue to uphold the Brotherhood’s mission and scour the Wasteland, reclaiming pre-War sites in search of valuable technology. And that includes the Commonwealth. Despite the Minutemen now in control of the majority of the Commonwealth, They deem the Minutemen in the way of their mission and proceed to invade the territory of the Minutemen, causing death and destruction for the sake of their mission. The Commonwealth is now in ruins, with Raiders, Super Mutants and Outcasts in charge of the New Wasteland, where homelessness, poverty and starvation are now commonplace.

Fallout 5 is set after the destruction of the Minutemen, instead of a Vault Dweller stuck out of time, players will be in control of a scarred young adult who grew in a peaceful settlement and saw the destruction of it (Perhaps in Sanctuary) and watched her/his parents die protecting it, then a war-torn Boston as an orphan and later a scavver. The Player can side with either the Outcasts, Raiders, help the Minutemen Resistance retake Boston or with the Railroad. Nick may still be found with the Railroad hiding in an undisclosed location. Strong may have found riding with another Super Mutant Gang, MacCready, Cait, Piper and other human followers in Fallout 4 are either dead or old. New followers such as Dogmeat or the railroad/Outcasts/Raiders may appear and old companions like Hancock or X6-88 may still be found. (Preston Garvey and the Sole Survivor died fighting in the final Stand at the Castle). 

This is all really just a shower thought or something I think of when I go to sleep and is really all just a pipedream. But one can dream :).

1. The Lone Wanderer largely disappears from public eye, with rumors circulating that they headed West, headed to The Commonwealth, returned to Vault 101, retired to Megaton and some even say they're flying a UFO throughout space.
2. Popularized by Three Dog, the Lone Wanderer becomes a folk hero in the Capital Wasteland, with many people creating and sharing stories about the figure, with most being popular with Wasteland Children with some drawing a big 101 on their backs to emulate their hero.
3. Three Dog begins to air a Radio Play based on the Lone Wanderer similar to the Herbert Daring Dashwood Plays, with HDD himself playing the role of James, though he'd rather play the Lone Wanderer.
4. With Harold's Heart accelerated, lush, green plants begin appearing in the Wasteland within a few short years.
5. Thanks to Project Purity, Rivet City expands and becomes a powerful Settlement in the Wasteland.
6. Overseer Amata opens the Vault and begins trading with outsiders. They eventually expand into the nearby Springvale and develop friendly trading relationships with Megaton and Big Town.
7. Members of the Enclave who weren't at the destruction of Raven Rock and Adams Air Force Base left their old lives behind and resettled into new ones, missing the old days in Raven Rock and the Enclave who once terrorized the Wasteland became a distant memory.
8. Paradise Falls is sacked by an unknown person and ironically, is eventually transformed into a safe haven for escaped Slaves to rest and resupply while on their way to the Lincoln Memorial.

591,Fallout,"Short version here: Is Local Leader 'necessary' for a normal difficulty (not playing survival) run? Does it really only shine in Survival? I'm not sure how useful settlements are as I've never played any FO4, and I've mainly studied up only on SPECIAL stats and perks (planning out my build now).



I've played lots of FO3 and FONV over the years, but finally preparing to dive into FO4. I'm also interested in tips for a first-time build for a first playthrough. I don't want to do melee first, I want to do a gun build, and probably Sniper/Sneaky (so Rifleman?). I'd like to go heavy in Luck. I'm currently trying to figure out how to allocate my starting stats, and I'm thinking I may start with less than the 6 Charisma required for Local Leader if it's not all that necessary or helpful in Normal mode. I don't really care about building pretty settlements, if that's what building is like in this game, but if having bigger settlements gets me more caps, or ammo, or useful stuff, I'm all about that.

I've decided I want to prioritize Luck, and I don't think I need any points at all into Strength or Endurance (none of the perks seems crucial to the build I'm going for).

Any tips on how to do the above, where to put the points, etc? Scrounger seems nice, so I need a little intelligence, Agility will be somewhat important as I will try to use VATS a lot. The Penetrator perk from Perception seems really cool, but a whipping 9 PER is quite the investment.

611,Fallout,"So exactly one year ago I was shuffling through the Appalachian wasteland. I was around Lvl 45. Couldn't carry any good legendaries. I'd about ground the game to the point where it wasn't fun any more. I was thinking about quitting. Imagine a sad lonely fallout player character shuffling in the rain waiting for events. And that was me.

When an event popped. I fast traveled. Loaded up what was left of my gear. And was ready to just exist in the background and rack up XP. One thing was different about this event. A few of the players had area chat going and where communicating. One of them called me over for help and I snapped to. Jumping in to the heart of the action aside them.

One of the players was Lvl 250 (give or take) so an absolute unit. It was this lady. She was blanketing the area in fire and felling enemies left and right. It was glorious. I didn't feel useless either. She gave me some ammo when I ran out. And encouraged me to get in there. I think it was a queen fight. So it was invigorating to finally have someone calling out legendary enemies when they spawned. And even let me score hits to get legendary gear!

Later that day she have me loads of medical items, food, recipes, plans, ammo, and a ton of materials. After which we kinda just hung out. Next thing you know she asks. ""How old do y'all think I am?"" (It was me and some other dude I ain't seen since then.) He answered 20's I answered 30's. She got a really good chuckle out of the first answer. Then rolls off with. ""I'm 60..."" The other anon guy is flabbergasted. Me knowing about Shirley Curry kinda didn't question it.

They guy loses his fucking mind. Not in a bad way. But to an almost weird extent. He just couldn't grasp that someone her age had the time or patience to sit and play 76 for that long. He disappeared. And I ended up playing with her more often. She even handed me my first Lvl 50 legendary! It was alike that kid opening his Red Ryder BB gun in that movie I can't remember right now but everyone knows.

It's been a year. And a tribe has formed around this lady. In fact a lot of ladies older than me make up the bulk of our tribe. She's become the defacto matriarch. And is a mainstay in the game. Whenever she's on. I don't feel alone while playing. Ever since she's helped me put ammo down range, chems in my inventory, and resources in my scrap box for building. I've levelled all the way to 222. She just hit level 770 (Around there).

She's a tough one in real life too. The pandemic reared its ugly head. And she came down with coronavirus. And ya know what happened? Like making a deathclaw eat a mini nuke. SHE BEAT THE FUCK OUT OF THE RONA! She's still kicking around being the sweetest Fallout grandma. Handing out ammo and chems. She'll even talk you up when you're feeling down.

Fallout 76 is still not perfect. A couple things I still don't like about it and how bethesda chooses to run it. But what makes it perfect enough for me to log on and play for a while.

Thanks for any info you guys can give me.",Questions about Fallout 76 (PS4)
617,Fallout,"I for one think the game should work like a tabletop game in this regard. 

In my opinion You should never be allowed to max out every skill and stat. You should be choosing your skills based on what type of character your want to play as, Stealth, Science, Combat, Diplomacy, etc... and while you should be able to do whatever you want. You shouldn’t be able to make the best / easiest decisions every single time regardless of play style. 

I guess in theory you don’t need a level cap to do this. But regardless I think it should be impossible to come anywhere close to having max stats. There should be something preventing you from acquiring all skills and stats and perks. 

I think that the perk tree system that action games typically use: ones that have you play as a set character but overtime you unlock all of their abilities. Is fun but takes away from the role playing aspects of Fallout and Elderscrolls and ultimately make most characters and play throughs feel the same. 

Of the most recent systems used in their games: 

Skill System (New Vegas)
Perk System (Fallout 4)
Cards  System (76)
Experience based system (Skyrim)

I personally find them all lacking. But I also believe they’re lacking because developers aren’t willing to force players to specialize. 

New Vegas has the closest to my ideal system   It has traits, skill checks and challenges, but speech is still op, charisma is a dump stat and there’s not much weapon specialization outside of perks. 

Atom RPG actually addresses these issues by dividing up the weapons skills further 

-	Shot guns and rifles
-	Pistols and SMGs
-	Automatic Weapons 
-	Explosives
-	Throwing
-	Melee
-	Martial Arts

And it makes Charisma affect who is willing to talk to you outside of your speech skill. So it isn’t a dump stat. Your character can be really convincing but it won’t help much if your attitude and appearance turn people off from interacting with you to begin with. There’s also a perk you can acquire by reading a book that teaches you street slang. So your character can prove to shadier characters that they’re in the know.

But it lacks challenges and then again I don’t know how well that stuff would transfer into a first person game. 

Even Outerworlds which while I love that they divided up the speech system, is held back by the simple fact that it’s too generous to the player and allows them to specialize in too much. 

And how do you handle the gun problem? In my opinion weapons that the player isn’t good with should have more sway like Fallout 3. Then as you specialize the sway is reduced but I can also see that being frustrating early on. 

Skyrim is the most immersive but it can also be incredibly tedious and lacks anything to prevent the player from mastering every skill and allowing them to choose any path at any time regardless of their play style. Which I think cheapens the game. You aren’t role playing anymore. You aren’t forced into uncomfortable situations. You’re just choosing the best option from a list. 

So do you prefer more action rpg elements or RPG Specialization elements? Level cap or no Level Cap? Mechanic preference?","Level Caps, Skill systems, Immersion, and Role Playing. What’s important to you?"

624,Fallout,"Hello! My name is Cristian. I have played and thoroughly enjoyed both the Fallout and Elder Scrolls series since 2008. 

This morning, my grandfather passed away from natural causes. He was a music teacher, rancher, and veterans advocate for all of his life. He was a pillar of the community here in Laredo TX. He was born on a small ranch in South Texas in 1927, and while he never showed much interest in video games, I know that this morning he received the good karma ending. 

The reason that I am writing this is because I would like to request that my grandfather, Elmo Lopez, might be honored in the next Fallout game in some way if possible. He played the trumpet his entire life, and his love of 1950’s musicians like Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, and Bing Crosby are what allowed me to connect with the Fallout series in a more deep and meaningful way.

I know in my heart that being associated with great musicians like these in a Fallout game would bring him great joy. The Fallout series has always made great strides in creative innovation, and introduced an entire generation of men and women to the joys of music that they might not have listened to otherwise. My grandfather would be elated to be involved, in even a very small way, in a series that has accomplished this so effectively.

It makes you happy and you spend a great amount of time, patients, passion and money into it.  But the more time passes with it more this lovely kind of few changes and you start to get a rational, realistic look at it. You begin to see its flaws (bugs). Things that appeared perfect to you are now not that perfect after all (Fallout NV being unfinished and therefore lacking content in some parts.

Maybe you don't even like the way it is heading right now (Fallout 76's online gameplay and micro transactions). The truth is that there may have been flaws and mistakes from the beginning that maybe even tent to grow bigger. But the thing is that you still can't hate it.

I recently watched Blade Runner for the first time, and aside from the main theme of the stories, I noticed a lot of smaller references and easter eggs that have previously gone over my head.

    Covenant's SAFE test is a reference to FO3's GOAT, but it's also a reference to the Voight-Kompff test used in Blade Runner to distinguish humans from replicants.

    Takahashi's noodle stand is a reference to the noodle bar Deckhard eats at in the beginning of Blade Runner. Takahashi uses the same greeting as the man in the movie.

    The Courser uniform looks a lot like Roy Batty's jacket. Like a courser, Roy Batty is a military-model replicant with enhanced combat abilities.

    Tyrell is the CEO of the corporation which makes replicants. Roy Batty cally Tyrell ""Father"" in their climactic confrontation, which is likely the inspiration for synths calling Shaun ""Father"" in the Institute.

    In a theater in FO4's downtown Boston there are a pack of mannequins on stage with one synth hiding among them to ambush you, a reference to the replicant ambushing Deckard at the beginning of the final fight.

684,Fallout,"I'm sorry about the clickbaity title, but I mean it, why doesn't the master consider using human livestock to breed potential mutants? For those who haven't played the game, in fallout 1 you can persuade the master to kill himself because mutants can't breed and therefore his plan to replace humans with mutants would put a clock on the extinction of mutantkind. This makes sense at first glance until you realise that mutans being able to breed is irrelevant to his plan, simply keep a group minimally irradiated but ""unworthy"" humans to breed and provide you with a steady supply of vat fodder. This idea came to my mind the first time I played fallout 1 and I assume it must have crossed the mind of at least 1 of the developers, and certainly the master would be able to consider it. I think having to persuade the master that slavery would taint his dreams of peace or that by relying on humans mutants would never be able to escape the failings of human society or anything other than ""mutants can't breed guess I'll develop depression and kill myself"" would have made the ending to fallout 1 just that bit more believable.

I think there should be a time limited window that cannot be exceeded, but I'm just not sure what would be a good one. 2 weeks? A month? A year?",Maybe nexus having the option to filter mods by most downloaded/endorsed of all time is a mistake and should not be a thing?
687,Fallout,"It doesn't have to be super underrated so long as it really improves the game for you. No need to link them but specifying where they can be found (Nexus, Steam Workshop, etc.) might be handy.

Here's a few that come to mind for me, all from the Nexus.

FNV
- Sit anywhere mod - Let's you sit down on the ground wherever you may be

- A World of Pain - Very famous but still the best mod I've seen in the last 20 years (and believe me, I've seen them all). Gives Fallout as many hidden locations to explore as skyrim except every one is handcrafted and unique with its own story to tell. 

-Dog City Denver - Visit Denver as it was before the war, a giant pile of rubble, dogs, and vagrants. Good voice acting, great world building, one very, very dangerous police station. 

FO4
- More Guards mods/exterior Diamond city defences  - Theres four different ones but they increase the guards number/quality of guards and turrets around Diamond City, Hancock's Hellhole, and Bunker Hill. No longer will a raider veteran or deathclaw single handedly take out NPC's all the defences of the last bastion of civilization. 

-Travelling NPCs - groups of friendly/non-friendly humans, animals, robots etc travel along roads and through the countryside while checking out stops along the way. Very customizable and really brings the world to life.

-Nest Shelters - adds little shelters all over the wasteland, from tiny to rather sizable. Each is hand designed and you can tell the creator tried to give each one its own little story. Sadly there no AWOP for Fallout 4 but his is kind of like AWOP lite. Also helps fill in the map with fast travel points.",Whats an underrated or niche mod for FO4 or NV you think more people should know about?
688,Fallout,"There's a random encounter in Fallout 4 when you come across two characters called Art, each stating they are real life Art and the other is a synth. 

I've played this game on and off for the past 5 years now. Several play throughs. Experienced this random encounter several times and it has just dawned on me that the whole thing is a nod to the idea that Life Imitates Art, only this time, it is Artificial Life Imitating Art. 

Mind. Blown. Can't believe I'm still noticing things like this.

FUN SIDENOTE: When this random encounter started I was in Bunker Hill and walked past Art who said ""can't believe that thing had my face"". Realised who he was and thought I must have missed the encounter and it was after the event. Carried on to the market to sell my wares when all of a sudden gunfire. Thought it must have been some raiders attacking the Hill, but instead it was Art and Art STILL fighting right in the middle of Bunker Hill. It was funny watching them have quite an epic fight (as it was in Bunker Hill there was a lot of cover so it lasted like 5 minutes!) and no one react or care to any of it.

I like coming across an area that requires special equipment or a high level of skill to overcome at a lower level. It feels like I’ve progressed. 

I really liked that in New Vegas you couldn’t just walk carelessly off the road at a low level. I wish the road had been a bit less straight and mindless to follow but I loved that deathclaws required you to be careful of you went north. I like that Cazadores ambush you.  I love that in Morrowind they tell you to take a break and get stronger before you move on to the next main quest.  I love that in Darksouls you can accidentally stumble into one of the most difficult areas of the game and get evicerated by unkillable enemies. 

I get that for casual gamers this sort of stuff can be frustrating but I don’t see why the more hardcore audience should have their experience watered down when there can be an easy comprise for this problem.

The player was supposed to be either the vault's head of security, medical staff, or maintenance/utilities (depending on the character's SPECIALs, basically head of any vault staff department, **not the overseer, to allow the player more RP freedom**)

Now, leading up to the bombs, there was no practice evacs, drills, or any preparation work, nor were you ever allowed to actually see the vault.

So, the day the bombs drop, you all rush to the location where the vault is supposed to be, just to find out it doesnt exist. A few of you survived at first, but people would begin succumbing to radiation poisoning in the weeks to come. Eventually, you decide to leave whatever makeshift shelter you and your fellow dwellers managed to assemble. You could find a nearby notebook or terminal or something with like the overseer's journal talking about how he thought it was odd that there wasn't any preparation or drills, and it was making him rather nervous, etc.

729,Fallout,"Because my unhealthy obsession with the series can't possibly be a problem if I end up making something out of it! 

It's going to be scripted like a screenplay, as I'm hoping an animator might pick it up and actually put it to screen. Some input from the community on the overall plot/which characters to include would be more than helpful, as well as motivating, thus the reason why I'm posting here instead of just writing the ~~shitty fanfiction~~ screenplay already. 

So basically the idea is this: Following the events of Fallout 4 (I'm open to suggestions as to which ending I should go with), the Sole Survivor receives a transmission through the HAM radio in the Red Rocket settlement. The transmission is patchy, as though it's coming from somewhere far outside the Commonwealth. Even more unusual is the transmission itself: a distress call, from what the survivor can gather, with a set of coordinates attached. Upon actually plugging in the coordinates, the survivor realizes this transmission somehow managed to come from all the way across the Wasteland, originating somewhere in the mountains of Northern California. 

The Sole Survivor, being the Sole Survivor, feels obligated to go, due in no small part to unrelenting boredom brought on by the monotony of helping settlements (they really don't have much else to do now that the big players of the Commonwealth are either [dead](/spoiler) or [peaceful](/spoiler)). However, hauling one's ass across over one thousand miles of irradiated, post-apocalyptic Wasteland is easier said than done. Luckily for them, there's word of a caravan that's recently stopped outside Goodneighbor, one claiming to have come from a place very near to where the Sole Survivor is headed. So, all one has to do is go over to Goodneighbor, convince the leader of the caravan, a mysterious man known only as Six, to let you hop on, maybe bring some friends along, and overall have a fun time, right?

... Right?

As of yet I have no idea which characters to include in the party, though there are some that I know I can't leave out. Hancock, Nick Valentine, Strong, Macready, Paladin Danse and Cait, to name a few. Great characters stuck in a shit game, all of whom could use some room to breathe and develop. Along the way I'm also hoping to bring in Arcade Gannon, Charon and Rex. 

However, I don't just want to make this for my own satisfaction. I want this to be something the community as a whole can enjoy, which is why I am, overall, leaving which companions to take along and flesh out to you guys.

733,Fallout,"As a Canadian and someone who just got into Fallout, I cannot help but imagine a Fallout game set in my local area. So, here is all of that in a post.

This game would be mainly set in Southern Ontario, with some of the map expanding to west towards Detroit, east towards Montreal, and a bit of the American-side of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario (Cleveland, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse)

Since by the time of the Great War, Canada was already part of the USA, so the nuclear holocaust would also affect Canadian cities such as Chatham-Kent, London, Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. The insuing fallout and nuclear winter would hinder any chance of locals getting back on their feet immediately.

The pre-war cultural aesthetic of Canada would be similar to the 60s to late 70s, as I can't imagine many people would want to live in 50s-inspired architecture for 120 years. So, architecture styles, fashion, and technology would be different in Canada. However, it would be plausible for some 50s-inspired Americana to creep its way across the border.

Since the American annexation of Canada was a bit violent, I could see a deep-rooted anti-American sentiment still persisting even 100 years later in Canada.

This game would take place maybe in the late 22nd century, early 23rd century. This would allow for any groups in Canada to get a good footing after the Great War. The Grand Toronto Area would be nothing but overgrown urban and industrial ruins as the landscape,  becomes increasingly residential and dense in Toronto and industrial as you make your way towards Hamilton. Small pockets of human life live in the GTA Wasteland, however it is mostly a grand abundance of wildlife as nature as taken over with small raiding parties venturing deep into the city searching for treasure.

The area referred to as ""Ronto"" is, in my headcannon, actually a large walled settlement located just on the edge of the GTA Wastelands (perhaps in North York), a hub for traders, travellers, entrepreneurs, convicts, basically any and all people from all walks of life, and would be one of the main settlements.

This game's map would be very large, perhaps near Southern Ontario's actual size of 140,000 km², (Fallout Tactic's is nearly 800,000 km²) and since it wouldn't be feasible walking a large distance in the game and only the urban areas of Southern Ontario and large American cities on Lake Erie/Ontario would be hit, this leaves much of the roadways and highways untouched. Perhaps there is a special group that helps guard and repair the freeways, allowing for the player and NPCs to travel between settlements using makeshift automobiles, made up of parts of pre-war cars and other equipment found in the area. 

Possible factions could include one based around the settlement of Ronto, or one based in the ruins of the Ottawa River Valley that are descendants of the Canadian government. One francophone faction based around Montreal. I could also see a few Commonwealth outposts around upper New York and Vermont, or a group of B.o.S. members in northern Ohio and the ruins of Detroit. There is also those highway guards I mentioned in the paragraph above. Maybe even a raider faction around the London area.

Anyways, thats my idea of a Fallout game based in Southern Ontario and surrounding area. At least I got all of my ideas down so I can hopefully stop thinking about it.",My idea for a Fallout title set in Southern Ontario and surrounding area.

&gt;&gt;&gt; After months of translation, the game still has much dialogue to present to us; but the progress is slowly and surely being made. Yet, it's not all about dialogue here.

PLEASE DON'T LEAVE COMMENTS ON THE LINES OF ""HA HA. NOOB CAN'T PLAY NEW VEGAS."" AS I HAD ALREADY BEATEN NEW VEGAS ON HARDCORE DIFFICULTY IN THE PAST. IT'S JUST THAT NOWADAYS, I AM HAVING TROUBLE PLAYING THROUGH THE GAME WITHOUT DYING OF BOREDOM\]

I used to play Fallout: NV for hours a day during the summertime of my young teenage years and nowadays, when I launch the game, it feels like a chore. Everything looks really bad, because the graphics aged super badly. The story feels uninteresting, because to me it's nonsensical than in a country where barely cities have formed, suddenly we have entire armies going to fight each other like in some sort of a Lord of the Rings movie.  
Radiation is poorly described, why is it green??? Why does it turn people into zombies?  
And quests feel oddly unsatisfying.  
Boone's quest is literally, find a girl, pickpocket her, open a safe, find note, bring girl in front of dinosaurs, head explodes.  
The areas seem extremely unbalanced. Most of the early game is filled with bandits that take one-shot to kill, pigrats, radscorpions and then suddenly there is an area with two supermutants armed with late-game weapons like the super-sledge or a 5mm minigun.  
There are Night Stalkers out of nowhere, you can deal with those, because they are squishy. But for some reason the game throws at you 10 Ghoul Ravagers backed up by the Glowing Ones.  
The Hardcore mode is just dumb, it adds nothing to the game, but causes you to waste time by looking for water and food, and occasionally being forced to sleep.  
And the Very Hard difficulty I chose to play on is unimmersive and makes enemies look ridiculously gimmicky... With enemies taking a lot of shots from my Plasma Defender (a mid game plasma pistol), before dying.  
It's also super hard to aim in this game, as plasma missiles never go where you aim them and melee enemies have unimaginably high movement speed. Aiming at them with VATS sure allows you to deal a lot of damage, but it also allows them to catch up with you if they are Radscorpions for example, although Radscoprions are not the problem.  
The Ghoul Ravagers are. Especially if they move in a ten-unit group.  
Also, rewards for exploration feel meager.  
The lake with the giant Radscorpions only offered a case of ammo. The moon canyon filled with Golden Geckos (I can't get the way how Sulik says Golden Geckos in Fallout 2. I'm having vietnam flashbacks to that game, just by saying Golden Geckos)... I got to that canyon and the only thing I got was an advanced radiation suit... Like, all I have to do is pop Rad-X. Who cares about the suit?  
The Legion feels dumb. How did this tribe of guys with swords manage to defeat NCR, which has somehow figured out how to manufacture weapons?  
And the final problem of all...  
How do groups of raiders the size of 10 manage to feed themselves in a desert where their biggest hunt can be a caravan armed to the teeth that consists of a group of 3. They can't even rob any towns. Because Goodsprings is in the middle of nowhere. Novac is well protected. And... Well...  
There aren't just that many random towns and villages to sustain a population of that size of roaming bandits.  
This is always the problem for me in terms of RPG games...  
There can be no bandits if the population is not big enough to hide them...  
If there is literally just a single point of populous, where bandits can come to rob someone, then how the hell do they survive without being nailed down?  
One of the powder gangers goes and says... ""NCR is sure scary, but this is a big desert, they won't find us"". EXCUSE ME!? Your CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IS A 2 MINUTE WALK AWAY FROM THEIR NEAREST BASE.  
LIKE... I GET THAT THIS IS NOT REALISTIC DISTANCES, BUT THE FURTHEST YOU ARE FROM THAT PLACE IS 3 HOURS OF WALKING... NCR LITERALLY HAS TO JUST WALK OUTSIDE AND THE ONLY THING PROTECTING YOU IS THAT THEY DON'T CARE!!!  
I wish there was a dialogue option to tell that guy to stop acting like a freaking ding dong, but this is another problem I have with Fallout: New Vegas.  
In Fallout 1 and 2 at least you had some unpredictable dialogue options.  
The capitalist ghoul of Gecko talking about greed.  
The Harold's weird story about exploring the Mariposa Military Base with his buds.  
The Decker contract.  
The cat story of the Den?  
I'm not some nostalgia fanboy, don't get me wrong. I've forced myself to play these games a year ago, and now that I'm done and finally came back to semi-modern times. Cuz New Vegas is considered very old now. I come to realize that even though those games were super clanky, the dialogue over there was semi-decent.  
And now I'm back at New Vegas, where everything just feels generic and poorly told.  
The way how Legion is introduced is just cheap...  
You walk into a town and then there is an edgy guy with a wolf's hat talking to you about how you have witnessed their power.  
""good job, you destroyed a town I have no idea what it was or who lived here. This vile act has as much impact on me as you killing a dog on the other side of planet Earth"".  
Alright, that's enough. You get the jyst.

I'm going to delete my save file and attempt to play the game without the dumbass Hardcore mode and on Normal difficulty so that I can focus on the narrative and perhaps enjoy the game, but as it stands, it feels like this game wants me to uninstall it and go outside.  
But there is no outside!!!

I like the way fo4 made their dlcs, being able to discover a brand new map AND being able to go in and out. I didn’t like how after the dlc with fo3 and new vagus, there wasn’t much to do there. The main story of the dlc is done, there isn’t much to do there. Fo4 did a great job on dlcs, and in my opinion better than new vagus, which is praised as having the best dlcs. I’d like to see the return of the minuteman, I feel that they made a impression on me.


A big thing I want is more of a moral choice. In fo3, it’s clear the enclave is bad. New vagus, legion is bad. Fo4 had a bit more morality in the main quest, but it was still clear that the institute were the bad guys.
I get that all the factions in all the games had their flaws, but it was just to easy to choose who to side with, and I’m telling you it wasn’t the legion. This plagues the Bethesda rpgs, even Skyrim has this this problem. Imperials bad, stormcloak a good

I hope that fo5 brings much more morality into the factions. I want them to make all the factions have more of a feeling that gives the player a really hard choice. I want each faction to be, in a word, nicer. They should have more morals and be improving the people. They should really feel like people. That’s why I love the minuteman, they feel real. They have their flaws, everyone does. Despite this, they are a good faction with good people",What do YOU wanna see in fo5?

809,Fallout,"If you're like me and still stuck on old gen consoles and want FO4 to run well, look no further, I have a solution. I couldn't get FO4 to stop crashing in Boston, stuttering, dipping frames and generally running like trash until I did this. Now I have it fully modded and experienced 2 crashes in *4 days, 20h, 27m* of play time and FPS is GREATLY improved, especially in Boston. 

Step 1: Buy an SSD compatible with your Xbox. I bought a cheap £50 SSD that has 256GB. Install FO4 on here.

Step 2: Download these mods, one at a time, following a load order, hard reset after each one - UFO4 Patch, Boston FPS Fix AIO, Insignificant Object Remover, Shadow Resolution 2048&gt;512, Optimised Building Textures, Optimised Landscape Textures, Disable God Rays, Nytra's Performance Tweaks, Boston Less Enemies.

I've had major success piling mods on top of this and still no experience impacting performance issues. I have several settlements built up, trade routes everywhere and the game still runs well, no micro stuttering at all.

I can even play survival without fear if losing progress.

Anyway, I hope this helps at least one person have a stable FO4 experience because it really is a brilliant game when it runs well!","Reminder: seeing as Fallout 4 is now on Gamepass, here are some tips to get it running well on your garbage OG Xbox/Xbox OneS/Xbox OneX!"

821,Fallout,"Problem with starting Fallout 4

Is anyone else experiencing this? I start the game, it does the “please stand by screen” then starts playing a video but then the sound cuts off and it freezes. It doesn’t crash to dashboard, just stops. The video also starts at random point? I’ve seen it start at “Why you’re Special pt5”, it’s started at pt2, pt1, and it’s started at the “please stand by” video screen. It always just cuts audio and stops about 5 seconds into playing. 

I’ve power cycled my Xbox. It’s my first time playing so I have no corrupted save files or mods interfering. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled.  Now it’s shows the main “please stand by” screen then goes to black and that’s pretty much it. Sometimes the Xbox will pop a message saying that it took too long to launch. I’m pretty stumped on this one, because other games launch with no problem. I’m close to just uninstalling and never playing it.

It is ironic that PlayStation owners who’s main argument is that PlayStation has better exclusives are now mad at the prospect of Xbox having good exclusives. 2. It’s a bit of an overreaction on their end because Microsoft has always been in the market of making money. Why would they bother making Fallout or Elder Scrolls exclusives when they can sell to both systems and make even more money?

He recently retired and had gotten an PS4 some time ago so my mom could play Tomb Raider and/or watch Netflix, though she never used it. I had mentioned to my dad all of the XBONE games that I owned after noticing he had a PS4 and mentioned how Fallout 4 and Skyrim were pretty much must-haves, and were also the style of game he would enjoy.

836,Fallout,"Exploring the ruins of Boston, most of our Sole Survivors have stumbled across **D.B. Technical High School**, a raider encampment sprawling every habitable nook and cranny of the former Catholic Tech School.

As we can read from the terminal entries from across the wastes and particularly here, the raiders of D.B. are headed by an insane man by the name of “**Bosco**” and right off the bat we notice some unique things.

Starting small, let’s look at his impact on the raiders around him. For example, should we kill Bosco before dealing with Saugus Iron Works’ Forged, we note that the killing of Bosco is the only thing that makes Slag think Commonwealthers are competent. This is coming from the leader of arguably one of the largest and most powerful raider bosses north of Pittsburg.

Not only that, but we can find out that he has subjugated most of the Boston raiders into his gang, with Back Street Apparel being the only independent hideout.

Continuing on noting Bosco’s achievement, we note that he has actual tactics on his side instead of throwing his men at the enemy like a hammer. Taking a look into his terminal entries, we discover that Bosco took out the Shamrock Taphouse gang by having a spy sneak into their ranks, break the locks, and then set loose Bosco’s dogs. Those that survived were offered a deal and they took it. Now, considering Shamrock Taphouse isn’t empty when we find it, we can infer the deal was assimilation.

To us, living in the modern age, this may seem basic and simple. But these are revolutionary tactics in the age of raiders and slavers. Not only does he use his resources effectively, he knows when to shut up and stop his expansion. We know this because he writes that he hasn’t taken Libertalia yet because his men wouldn’t know how to handle the terrain.

He knows his limits, he conquers and makes deals to maximize his efficiency, he uses tactics and diplomacy, he’s a genius compared to most of the other bosses.

We later learn that he was bitten by one of his dogs, and is slowly going insane because of rabies. He harshly punishes his own men, and has even set up a throne with the heads of his foes by his side.

There is an obvious connection to Caesar. He’s a tactical genius for his era and yet is irrational and brutal.

And what do we get out of the great Bosco? A repeating micro-boss encounter where the whole gimmick is “Haha funny bear head”.

Bosco was a massively missed opportunity and I’m ashamed of Bethesda for throwing him away.",Bosco: A Missed Opportunity.

\- Not get eaten by bears at the campgroud  
\- Not get shredded by the ghouls on the rails, or Gorski Cabin.  
\- Not get sniped by Gunner assholes on the overpasses dominating the area between his farm and the river.  
\- Keep Lucy from getting distraced by all the kitties (how the fuck is that lone catlady even alive?! Prostitution and Epic Cat Launcher?)  
\- NOT GET MASHED BY THE BEHEMOTH AT CARHENGE  
\- Not get noticed by the drunks at Beantown, Walter's posse, Red Tourette's crew, or those two fuckers using settlers for target practice behind his own damn house.  
\- Not get gorebagged by the mutants at the treatment plant.  
\- Somehow squeeze a Brahmin through that gap by the railcar behind beantown!? not likely. How has this not been moved in 200 years?! (I got a mod for that XD)  
All this to hug the river Eastward after Greygarden, along the water behind Cambridge Police Station, and hope that the rowdies at the Fraternity Post are asleep only to come to a raider bottleneck at the USS Riptide.  
Greygarden -&gt; Oberland -&gt; Vault 81 -&gt;Diamond city through the sunken tunnel with the scavenger merchant is literally the safest leg of the journey if considering all of the above, provided the obstacles are gone through.  
\_  
Going Southwest via the Runaway's Cabin, still takes him to the Ration depot, a deathclaw nest and the treatment plant- plus the minefield up between Nuka Station and Fort Hagen.  
\-  
His only other option is taking a huge detour to Watts Electronics via Starlight to Covenant- which of course is FUCKING COVENANT, but there's safety until BADTFL- which he needs to pass to get to Bunker Hill because the supermutants, ghouls, and raiders own everything between the frat post and the gift shop by bridge to the Pickman Gallery.   
Now of course he's fucked because Swan is camped out in the commons and theres a tower full of raiders along the river between Pickman Gallery and the Bandshell full of Hubologist wannabes.  
So unless a fully loaded Clarabell can swim, I can only assume that they've got a secret tunnel dug all the way to the city, or Lucy is secretly Wonder Woman- and we've already got her singing at the Third Rail. Probably should just sell his shit at Goodneighbor come to think of it.

887,Fallout,"TL'DR perks involved in Settlements and powere armor are unlocked and improved via gameplay not level ups. (Always was annoyed Settlement perks needed high charisma for a almost ecential feature and intellect really had no play resource management) paving the way for more utility perks. The new guns armor and crafting  being used in 76 are good, just tweak them a little and add more in the next fallout .

The way training would work is you get and improve it via training with a veteran powere armor user and using powere armor. The lower its leve the more the ap cost for sprinting and vats is along with suffering a movement penalty, high training move faster and unlock more modifications and better ap costs. Improving powere armor training would also retroactively unlock additional perks that improve powere armor.

For powere armor weapons, I saw the frank Horrigan miniature for wastland warfare had his knife and sword attacked to the armor. So I wondered what if future games built on that. The brotherhood  designing weapons that exclusively work with power armor fits with how they'd work. It would require power armor training and they should hit like a truck. Think a gatling lazor mounted to arms or shoulder mounted turrets. The BOS, enclave(if their not dead), and other factions have been using it for a while it stands  they make improvements to its combat ability. 

settlement are more self sufficient and the perks unlock via improving settlement not charisma. I don't like its dependence on charisma, store's and work benches unlock via having perks related to that store. Ex level 1 gunsmith = level 1 gun store and work bench. Supply lines are unlocked inherently after geting 2 or more setliments. And lastly settlers can build their own gear and arm themselves. Just less micromanagement having to a  settlement  becuse settlers can plant a apple by their self is annoying.  Just let them generate resources for me in the background.

I’ve debated posting this for the longest time but I’ve finally caved. I’ve tried all sorts of load orders and configurations.

902,Fallout,"I know this dead horse has been kicked so much that it came back to life and got kicked to death again, but where do you want the next Fallout game to take place in?  I've a few ideas myself:  
  
* Chicago's one good place.  It was stated in New Vegas that there are Enclave outposts there, and Fallout 3 and 4 mentioned a Brotherhood of Steel presence there as well.  It would be interesting to see another clash between the two factions.  
  
* New Orleans is an interesting place for a couple of reasons.  Seeing as the series has dabbled with the supernatural (the all but blatant Lovecraft references in Fallout 3, New Vegas, 4, and 76, as well as the cult in the Point Lookout DLC), New Orleans, with its long and storied history of the supernatural, has all kinds of possibilities.  Also, depending on how much water remains in the area, the possibility of vehicle travel (boats, rafts, and hoverboats specifically) also exists.  
  
* Alaska, the site of the last battle of the Great War, before the bombs dropped.  Perhaps the descendants of the US and Chinese militaries (as well as the ghoulified remnants of the original militaries) are still fighting a war that has long since ended?  A good plot idea would be for the player to either win the war for one side or the other, destroy both sides, or find a way to forge a lasting peace between the two factions.  Depending on what the weather's like, it would also be a good chance to expand on the survival system that Bethesda's been dabbling with the last few games.  
  
* New York.  Assuming the city hasn't been reduced to a Glowing Sea, it would be an interesting change of pace going through tight alleyways, flooded subways, and across the rickety ruins of skyscrapers as opposed to the more wide-open areas that the last few games have had.",Where do you want the next Fallout game to take place in?

919,Fallout,"In each game the story is *""War Never Changes, but can we?""*. War is always fuelled by greed and wrath but can humanity change to avoid those issues? Fallout 1 shows us a failed attempt via the Master, Fallout 2 shows us another failed attempt via the Enclave. Both of these attempts to change humanity both also revolve around eliminating those who are not apart of their groups. Turning humans into Super mutants and killing people who are not apart of the Enclave. Fallout 2 also shows us the NCR, a democracy and the fallout of the Master's actions. This parallels the real world more vividly as the NCR and Enclave are both flavours of the USA. In New Vegas this theme is taken to new heights with these ideas clashing in more direct ways. The NCR is huge and must fight against the Legion, an autocracy, similar to the Master. Or perhaps Mr. House is more similar to the Master, but with a refined version of their ideas, and of course the option of anarchy. These 4 ideas clashing it what makes New Vegas great plus the themes of greed are demonstrated nicely by the city of Vegas. New Vegas essentially has Fallout 1 and 2 fight, with even more factions mixed in. The NCR is good but is this history repeating itself? Will they have the same fate as the USA? 

**TL;DR: New Vegas is really smart. But, where does the series go after this? Where can we take ""War Never Changes, but can people?"" You could give New Vegas a canon ending, but it think that might damage the point of the game. Also, in New Vegas technology as escalated to the point that the apocalypse doesn't really feel like an apocalypse anymore, if the series continues in this direction will it loose touch with its desolate themes?**",What should Fallout do with War Never Changes?

I’ve played every elder scrolls game, including Arena. And every Fallout game, including the Interplay ones. I’m sure this topic has been beat to death, but I just want some other opinions. After Fallout 4, is anyone excited for 5? They completely ditched good quest design for the building system. I’m sure New Vegas is everyone’s “go to” however even fallout 3 had some great quests. I just felt fallout 4 was a first person shooter with too many raiders to kill, not enough settlements with interesting npcs or quests. If I’m wrong, maybe I’ll play it again. But I had to slug through it, and I downloaded 40 plus mods. Did I miss anything, or is that just how this game plays?

All it takes is one look at the art book and game files to understand why it looks the way it does. The assault rifle was literally the first weapon designed for fallout 4 and It was intentionally designed to be an oversized *machine gun*, the reason it takes so many design elements from real life lmgs and hmgs is because it was originally supposed to be a pmg/high hybrid, it was designed  to be a large weapon to look good when held by large power armor hands. Dont get me wrong I hate the design too, but I hate it in the context of its current role as an *assault rifle*. If it went down the path of say, fnv's lmg, and was balanced to be a rare and powerful machine gun (maybe even chambered in .308) then I would actually like the design a lot. As for the game files comment, in the game files all of the assault rifle meshes and textures sit inside a folder literally called ""MachineGun"" where as there is an assault rifle folder that contain an unused cut chinese assault rifle. When looked at from the perspective of its original design intention then its bot actually that bad imo, sure it looks weird with the barrel jacket, but it looks weird in a kind ""makes sense -ish"" way. Ive always wanted to make a mod that rebalances it into a rare powerful, .308 machine gun that falls under the heavy weapon perks. Its a shame the Chinese assault rifle was cut and the what was supposed to be the machine gun was awkwardly repurposed into a role it wasn't visually designed to go in. I dunno, to me understanding the context makes the whole thing a bit more palatable, and maybe I just don't want to default to ""dae bethesda bad because ugly gun?"".",Can we please stop misunderstanding the Fallout 4 assault rifle?

983,Fallout,"Marked for Spoilers because it kinda is, marked for NSFW for a specific reason.

I think the only real redeeming quality about Pickman is that the people he’s killing are raiders, but he seems like he’s probably one of the only Fallout 4 characters to *genuinely* be bat-shit insane.

Plus, here’s the NSFW part, has anyone else noticed how... erotic, he is? The way he gives you a pet name and talks in a seductive tone, leaving you a calling card in his safe with a heart drawn probably in the blood of Slab, who you just killed? I feel like that’s a really cool little detail about him clearly being a full-blown psychopath, like a manipulation tactic to get what he wants. I only did The pickman quest like one time when the game first came out, but I recently redid it and I seriously did not remember this fact.

Overall, 10/10 character, probably one of the most unique characters in Fallout 4, and if you haven’t explored the Pickman Gallery for some reason yet, or haven’t done it in a while, I’d really recommend going through it.

995,Fallout,"It is likely that one day (unless fallout dies because of bethesda's incompetence\[.........\]) that the east and the west will meet. It is likely (since typically ""good guys"" win) that the ncr will be at that meeting. But who will be there from the east? However, in that same sense. What will the ncr be by then and what is still now?

 Personally I love the world that bethesda has made on the east coast. The american retro future *look* of fallout 3 and fallout 4 pervades the map in such an interesting way that I can't help but love exploring their landscape. The dense regions of destroyed cities prevails a since of great discovery hidden deep below. Which is exactly what I think the whole east coast is. It is a side of the country that is a beast of its own right trying to burst out of its cage. 

The Commonwealth. Capital Wasteland. The Pitt. Whatever West Virginia is going to nearly 200 hundred years later. Whatever other big faction that may appear. There is a country ready to be born. 

Here's my pitch:

The East Coast establishes itself as the next america. With inventory of the legitimate documentation and legacy of the first president, the sole survivor. This new america represents a return to the real america of old. A dial back from the horrendous beast it had become by 2077. 

The context:

Following the events of a peaceful minuteman ending. Conflicts (whatever they may be, in the form of war with the pitt, west virginia, rogue mid-western bos faction, the long shot legion, or maybe a waaagh! horde of supermutants with deathclaw mounts) arrises and requires that the three wary factions have to fight together in order to prevail. Uniting through the sole survivors acquired charisma as the general of the MM and civilizing the whole northern half of the commonwealth. Through a series of trials, falls, and rebounds in diplomatic trust. Along with compromise being the cornerstone of diplomacy. A real sense of camaraderie blooms into a united forces.

The reason America 2.0 (or maybe .5?) being possible is the sole survivor's hinted disillusion with pre war america.  With his relative experience with  pre war america and plot points hinted from the intro scene. He could have a since of retro patriotism. Which would have been grown by the grandfather he mentioned. Couple that with his archetyple general role on cusp of a new country. He'll likely be the one to lead the EBOS and RR into a new rule. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why this division of the country (between west and east) matters:

While the ncr does represent america with it's democratic ideals and values. It is still a far cry from true american ideals and established governing strucutre. From my understanding the ncr government and constitution also lacks all the pre-existing conditions for a true american philosophy. While in the east there seems to be a big plot device that american themes still prevail. All the documentation. The old world government structures. The militia. There is also the fact that America from before it became a united commonwealth was a constitutional republic. While the ncr is a ""federal unicameral parliamentary republic based on the principle of representative democracy.""  

The differences wouldn't end there. The NCR would have more emphasis rapidly expanding imperial-esk traits. While the east would have more emphasis on industrial expansion and technological innovation (due to all the exiting factories still seemingly operable and the EBOS's technical and  manufacturing guidance). 

&amp;#x200B;

When they meet in the middle:

There will be significant differences in ideology and values between the nations. That there would likely be war. I'm honestly not certain how the two would have progressed by that point. The kind of development that would be required for the east here would likely take a century. Beforehand they would be significantly weaker than the entire brunt might of the ncr. However, there is still the huge of middle america and the legion forces that should still exist (albiet divided like old rome) that should act as a solid buffer keeping ncr somewhat contained on the western side. At least for a good while for which the east could have finally gotten on its two legs.

&amp;#x200B;

Who would win:

Idk. The ncr is big and there is no telling what new branches or what kind of military arms it develops by then. For the east there is going to be a lot of things to consider and a likely hood for solid variability in capabilities. It'll likely have a developed cia of some sort due to the early espionage practices that were exposed to it thanks to the RR. There is the army that would likely have a solid growth from the MM. There would also be the (space) marines who could project a solid offense anywhere at short notice due to the EBOS's established advanced fighting doctrine with combined arms and integration of technology with power armored infantry rifleman.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading.

1018,Fallout,"So as we all know Honest Hearts is the second dlc for Fallout New Vegas and in my opinion the most disappointing one. 

I remember when I first played Dead Money and how amazed I was by the aesthetics, it was still new vegas but it had a very distinct feel to it. You could tell Obsidian put a lot of effort into designing the world, characters, creatures, armor and weapons. 

So when I started Honest Hearts I had a lot of expectations. When I met the Happy Trails caravan and heard the stories of Zion and it’s tribals I was really hyped, the caravan members themselves were cool characters too. 

We arrived at Zion, the scenery was breath taking, Jed and the caravan guards were such interesting characters, I was ready for an indians vs cowboys type scenerio. Then all my caravan buddies died. I was suprised but intrigued, maybe this was going to be a tribal vs tribal, primal warfare kind of deal. Then they started shooting with automatic rifles. 

First of all let’s talk about the Tribals. They look amazing, their aesthetics and the details went into making each tribe look distinct are simply a work of art. But they wield submachine guns, powerfists, shishkebabs and other technological weapons as such. 

I am aware of the lore reasons behind the existence of those weapons, but that lore was introduced in Honest Hearts at the first place, so fair game. 

Just imagine how cool it would look if the tribals were carrying only the primal weapons like spears, tomahawks or war clubs, it would create a contrast between the more civilised Vegas and Zion. And I would have really preferred had they introduced bow and arrows instead of just another submachine gun.

On the other hand Joshua bringing .45’s to Dead Horses to give them an edge against the White Legs is a good idea, as Joshua is a new Canaanite and .45 pistols were invented by a mormon. 

But when I see tribals running at me with automatic rifles and shishkebabs it feels like a lost opportunity. They don’t feel “uncivilised” as we were lead to believe. They just don’t give off that primal vibe tribals of Arroyo gave in Fallout 2. And this makes it hard to distinguish the tribals from fiends or other raiders.

Second let’s talk about Zion itself. Where are the animals? Where are the deers, the owls, the amphibians, the condors? A mutated bird of prey or a radstag would fit perfectly in Zion but they choose to put the same creatures as in mojave. Why is the water so clear? How are fish in it and not in anywhere else?

And this is my biggest problem...Why are they calling the bears Yao Guai? The barely English speaking Sorrows know Chinese or something? The mutated bears are called Yao Guais because the Chinese people at the internment camps called them as such. So did the Sorrows, a closed community that never left zion, had contacted one of those internment camps and learned what the mutated black bears, which aren’t even native to Zion, are called?

I think the voice acting is terrible and is the worst of Obsidian. I like Joshua and Daniel, their philosophy is interesting and so alien to the wasteland. I like the story of White Legs invading Zion to appeal to Caesar. I like the story of the Survivalist. And this is why the dlc as a whole is disappointing. With some changes it could have been perfect but Obsidian chose not to make these changes thus making Honest Hearts underwhelming.",My problems with Honest Hearts (long)

1020,Fallout,"Some friends and I had a discussion about the Fallout 4 Start screen (The first screen you see with the Red Rocket Station with Goodies inside it) and we came up with the idea that the reason you cannot find the Red Rocket station in the game is more of a fact that it is after the events of Fallout 4 than just showing off gear and items.

The reason we believe this is:

- Red Rocket Station not in main Game area, the region that is shown is not in the FO4 game.

- Codsworth may be the Mr. Handy unit you see on the ground in the garage area.

- Many weapons and tools are organized.

- the pip-boy in on the work bench than on the wrist.

- Has many comic books displayed and one Bobble head is shown.

We know this is just speculation since there is no real facts (That we found anyway), but with the few things listed above, it does seem more likely that after the main game, the Sole survivor leaves the commonwealth and settles somewhere in another area outside of where FO4 takes place.

Hey, it’s me again. The complainer


Companions. We love ( most of ) them, and they bring company to your game. The other games did a great job at companions, a good backstory to them and made them like able. The main thing is, they made them good at combat and action In general


Then came fallout four. The companions are even more fleshed out in this game, with their own likes and dislikes. Bethesda did a amazing job at making companions likable, but failed and making them good at actually being companions. One problem I noticed is how most of them come with shit guns like db shotguns and 10mm pistols. Sure, some come with decent weapons like Paladin dance and his laser rifle, but most come with bad ones.

Another problem is that they have really, really bad aim. They can’t hit their shots unless the enemy is right up. The only one who can actually hit stuff is deacon and old long fellow, but that’s only 2 out of the many companions. Due the this, they eat through the ammo that you give them for the the guns you gave because their weapons suck.

My last problem is a obvious one, they are buggy. It’s fallout 4, of course they are buggy. But companions really struggle to do basic things like orders or fighting.

Again, some of these problems don’t affect some companions, but most do.

But at the end of the day, we got dog meat so like that’s a win",My problem with companions ( fallout 4’s companions)

1061,Fallout,"Honestly, they aren’t scary, they are just annoying to deal with. High health, high speed, high damage, there are literally is no downsides to them. They’re just bullet sponges that are super fast. 

Now, do I prefer 4’s over them? In some aspects, yes. I like they’re more “organic” movement and actual reaction to being hurt instead of having their head bashed in then running again like nothing happened. I like how they actually try to dodge and throw things to distract or kill the player. Also I’m glad they look more reptilian and don’t have abs anymore.

However, their name Deathclaw has been tarnished. They aren’t all that deadly, especially their claws. I’d like it if maybe the higher the level, the more aggressive they’ll be. For example:

A normal Deathclaw will be like a normal Deathclaw, dodging and what not. But something like a savage Deathclaw should be more aggressive, doing less dodging and instead charging at players. Maybe even add a % of armor they ignore, with higher level ones ignoring more armor.","Deathclaws in Fallout 3 and New Vegas aren’t scary, they’re annoying."

My problem is how they just don’t feel... natural. Let’s say I get a quest, and it just auto points me to a random location to either find something or someone. I wish they felt more natural, like “ask around for the location” or “investigate someone’s room.”

A good example of this is the Chinese stealth suit creation club. You would have no idea that that is where the suit is, the game just shows you there. It would be cool if the quest starts out like “ grab a drink from the diamond city bar” or you find a random raider with a note to the location of the armor.

While yes, some quests are like this, most aren’t. I feel like if the quests introductions were more natural and not just “ go here,” they would be much better",My problem with fallout quests

And I mean like, *actual* communism, the economic and social philosophy of communism, not the goofy, one-dimensional caricature found in all the in-game propaganda. Something a bit more nuanced and rounded than simply slapping a red star on a hat and calling everyone ""comrade"". Fallout has explored many other types of government and philosophies: anarchy, democracy, autocracy, plutocracy, imperialism, totalitarianism, etc. but communism just seems to vaguely exist as the boogieman of a bygone era, something that all the crazy robots shake their metal fists at going ""grr filthy commies grr"" and that's it.

Honestly I think it would be interesting to see how a communist rule would fare in post-apocalyptic America. They could explore its strengths and weaknesses, maybe make parallels to real-life communist countries, and pit it against different factions with radically different beliefs. Players could learn more about communism, and even discuss and debate over its merits and flaws the same way that we still debate over the various factions in *New Vegas*. I mean, I honestly don't know much about Communism, and from what I've seen a lot of Americans know even less about it, beyond that it's ""bad"" in a non-specific manner.

1097,Fallout,"If the next Fallout game happens to be set in Texas, here is an appropriate quest, I think. 

Imagine that you're trekking down some overgrown country road. (The highways can be dangerous, especially the further you are from civilization.) You're passing by an old driveway - the stone mailbox still stands - when you see a man running down the driveway to you. He's armed, but not holding his rifle as he approaches you. This guy doesn't seem to be a survivalist, so he's probably okay. 

He's traveling to Houston, a/k/a Space City, from Lafayette. He explains that, in Louisiana, the only significant animal threat that he faced were the mutated alligators, and his double-barreled elephant gun was ""perfect"" for snuffing them out. Now, though, in East Texas, there are more wildlife threats, and they can move faster, and they can move in groups. He wants to know if he can trade for an automatic rifle. 

He's temporarily squatting in the house at the end of the driveway, and he's worried for the safety of his kids. If you downplay his fears, he indignantly retorts, ""How am I going to kill the 30 to 50 feral hogs when they run into the yard while my kids are playing?"" 

If you trade him an automatic rifle (he will not part with Perfection, his elephant gun) and some ammunition, he'll say, ""Thanks,"" and you'll find him and his kids in Houston later. 

If you don't trade him an automatic rifle, and also don't tell him that the Ghoul technicians down at the Bay City nuclear power plant are looking for a full-time hunter to kill the mutated alligators that keep nesting in the cooling reservoir, then if you ever return to the house then you will find him and his children have been trampled to death. 

If you don't trade him an automatic rifle, but volunteer to kill the nearest threatening sounder of feral hogs, he'll thank you and seek refuge in the house to wait as you slaughter them. If you tell him about the hunter job, then you'll find him in Bay City a week later. 

If you kill him and don't kill the feral hogs, then the kids will run into the woods and never be seen again. However, coincidentally, the survivalists in the area will demonstrate greater skill at booby traps and sniping, unless you have already killed the survivalists. 

If you kill him after killing the feral hogs, then his kids will go catatonic and remain the house. After you leave the area, a new traveling family will adopt them. Then, the next time that you go to Houston, you will discover that you have permanent damage to your reputation. 

If you want to be an asshole, then you can track down the family and show off Perfection to the orphans. The step-dad will then crowdsource retaliation that will unexpectedly stalk and harass you around Houston for the rest of the game. 

However, if you return Perfection, and apologize to the orphans, then your reputation will improve with time, and the vengeful stepfather won't try to have you harmed.

1115,Fallout,"Worst to best

Fallout BoS: Doesn't need a reason as to why the story sucks

Fallout Tactics: Not very story heavy, it's a gameplay focused game

Fallout 76: The story doesn't make much sense, 500+ people were supposed to be in Vault 76, but only a limited amount of people are on a server at once. This means the world is both underpopulated according to written lore, and overpopulated. The story is also a big big trail of notes left by people more interesting than you or your situation.

Fallout 3: Unpopular opinion, but I think Fallout 3 takes the story elements from Fallout 1 and 2, but completely misunderstands why those stories are so good. The ending sucks, and it sucks worse when it was retconned by Broken Steel. Youre rarely the main character.

Fallout 4: This one deserves more credit because Bethesda at least came up with the villian on their own. That being said, the Institute's motivation is non existent, and the player character no longer has a unique personality. Father is your son twist makes this game feel like a disney story.

Fallout 2: A near perfect narrative continuation of the first game, the plot points and universe elements are advanced in a realistic and understandable way for the most part. The villians are a bit too mustache twirling, but they have an understandable motivation and Frank Horrigan to make up for it.

New Vegas: Again, a near perfect narrative continuation of the game that came before (in the timeline). It copies Fallout 3's chasing a guy across the wasteland, however, it feels a lot more natural and it only takes up the first act. It is also completely skippable.

Fallout 1: A game with a 10/10 story. Master is a sympathetic villian, giving him the balancd of being both unforgivingly evil and correct, from a certain point of view. This one relied on no iconography, and does the retrofuturism thing really really well.

1121,Fallout,"TL;DR, I believe New Vegas destroys Fallout's ideas by taking them to their natural conclusion and subsequently ruins the possibility for a game that has a story that keeps the themes and ideas of Fallout mainly. ""War never changes"" and its counter ""But can we change?"". Please let me know your ideas for where the next game should explore thematically, and it there is anywhere left to go

&amp;#x200B;

I think that Fallout 5 has run out of places to go. The Fallout series generally revolves around the idea of history repeating itself through the idea of war. ""War never changes"". The way we fight may change but it will always be caused by the same human evils. Greed, wrath, etc. Primarily greed, as the Fallout 1 intro focuses on that idea a lot by pointing to the Roman empire and how greed is the same thing that drove humanity to destroy the world. The way we fight evolved to the point that it was able to destroy us. This idea ripples through the series as you explore the fallout of it and get to see the ways it still manifests itself and attempt answer the questions it present and serve to boost the idea of human division and greed. ""War never changes"". In the first game you are also met with this idea's counter. War may never change, but can we? The Master tries to change humanity in order to stop war in quite a literal way, by evolving us into Supermutants that have no barriers of identity and in turn by doing this starts a hypocritical genocide. History repeats itself. Fallout 2 attempts to evolve beyond this idea and counters the counter. The Master tried to fix humanities issues but ending up perpetuating them. Now, we can see a more direct parallel of the pre-war world. The NCR directly parallels the USA. Fallout 2 takes place decades after the first instalment and demonstrates what the Master tried to stop. The Enclave hate the rest of humanity as they are different than them. The NCR have many issues of their own. History is repeating itself, yet also changing. The wasteland changes. There are fewer areas in Fallout 2 that are destroyed by the wasteland, humanity has almost revived itself. At the end of the game you can stop the Enclave and the NCR continues to grow, will the NCR learn from history. In New Vegas the idea of the wasteland changing are literally demonstrated. The world's design is now 3d and the map is open world. Civilization has repaired itself to the degree that things are reasonably close, a more direct parallel for the real world. The NCR meets the Legion and Mr. House, more literal representations of the ideas presented in Fallout 1 &amp; 2. These factions personify their political ideologies and allow these ideologies to quite literally battle. Fallout 1 &amp; 2's ideas crash together. We can try to change war but often end up repeating it. We must learn from history. But when we don't change war the same problems arise. How do we learn from history? What is the right decision? Can humanity finally change? How do we change? What is the right answer? I feel that this takes the thematic ideas of the series and the wasteland genre to their conclusion. Humanity is destroyed, can it rise up again? As it does through instalments the wasteland slowly becomes less wasteland-y until in New Vegas you have literal cities. Ideas of war and the management of them grow until they are almost unanswerable. New Vegas is the best game in the series because of how it uses Fallout's ideas, but at the same time it destroys them. Am I missing something?

1126,Fallout,"First off, I understand this was mainly done for gameplay reasons, but I just want to know if there's a reason in the lore for this.  

What I mean more specifically is why did Vault 13, 15, 18, etc get equipped with Pip Boy 2000s, while 11, 21, 34, 101, 87, etc get equipped with Pip Boy *3000s*, and Vault 81, 111, 88, 95, etc get equipped with Pip Boy 3000 *MK IVs*? I get that Vault-Tec didn't exactly have the time to create one unified Pip Boy design, but if they made the Pip Boy 3000, and had enough time to make at least 3 other versions, then why did they give so many Vaults the objectively less useful Pip Boy 2000 (missing Geiger counter, no arm strap, etc)?  

Also, the Vault Suits are given different designs in the different games (Though to be fair, this may be more of an artstyle/perspective difference that makes them look different).  

The only thing I 100% understand is the difference between 10mm pistols. I've always thought the idea was that Vault-Tec just bought whatever 10mm was most common in the region (The Colt 6520 was popular in California so they bought them for their Vaults, the N99 was popular in Virginia so they bought them for *those* Vaults, etc).

1131,Fallout,"TL;DR Could Fallout handle death in a better way than just loading a save? Maybe the narrative could shift, maybe you are given special perks or flaws to reflect that. Or could the way saving is handled in Fallout be changed? Ex: Player crafted checkpoints. Please let me know what you think of my ideas!

**big post**

Recently, I've seen the request for the nemesis system to be implemented in Fallout. This is currently not possible as it is patented by WB Games but Microsoft has allegedly been looking into buying that studio. Regardless of licensing, I think it would be really interesting to see a system similar to this in Fallout. If you don't know, the nemesis system is a system found in the Shadow of Mordor series of games. It is essentially a system that generates relationships between the player and enemies. You might run away from battle and an enemy will remember that next time. Or, an enemy may kill you and move up the ranks of the orc military. For a better explanation watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm\_AzK27mZY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm_AzK27mZY). One of the things that makes this system work is the fact that the player's death causes a shift in the power structure of the enemies, but also that the player's death is part of the story. This got me thinking about how Fallout handles death. In these games, when you die you load a save and your death is not considered part of the story. But I think it would be interesting if the player dying could change parts of the story. Maybe it could shift the power structure of the factions in the game, causing one to take over the territory of another. Either way, do you think Fallout could handle death in a more interesting way?

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe something similar to The Outer World's flaws system, something Fallout could realistically use. With the flaws system if you die to an enemy too many times you are given the option to develop a fear of it, which allows you to trade higher damage from that enemy for a perk. Shadow of Mordor is a fantasy series which means your character doesn't die because they are stuck between life and death. Fallout is more grounded in reality, which means there needs to be a way to account for this. Possibly something like Bioshock's via-chambers? Maybe you don't always die and companions can drag you to safety if you are downed? Maybe the player character has some special mutation that causes them to not die when they are ""killed"", but to further mutate into a creature of the wasteland, gifting you access to more perks and abilities (I understand this must be hard to implement). This would not only make death more interesting, but also make the game more ***immersive***

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe Fallout's save system could just be changed. Abusing quick-saves is really easily and boring. Maybe players could save at certain in game points, but also use materials to create a save point. This way you have an interesting dynamic of, I could save here because there might be difficult things ahead or I could use these materials to make better gear. This also gives the things you find in the game world more value as you have a new important thing to craft.

1132,Fallout,"A lot of Fallout fans (particularly old-school Fallout fans) share the sentiment that the last few years have been somewhat of a low point for the Fallout franchise.

There has been a lot of talk about how to ""revive"" this series. Disillusioned by Bethesda, one solution which fans repeatedly propose is to allow Obsidian to produce another Fallout game. Many people are convinced that this is the golden ticket to rejuvenating the lost spirit of the original fallout games. 

What this suggestion ignores is that most of the key writers and designers who worked on Fallout NV have moved on, and they no longer work at Obsidian. HOWEVER, even if the original team were to reassemble and start work on a sequel to NV, I still maintain that this game would probably end up being a  disappointment. 

The hype surrounding this game would be immense, probably surpassing hype levels for FO4. It would invariably be bulldozed by the hype train. We all know how easily a game can be choked by hype. There are very, very few games made in recent memory which have truly lived up to the hype surrounding them. Whether a NV sequel would pull this off is dubious at best.","If there was a sequel to Fallout:NV made by Obsidian in the future, it would probably end up being a disappointment due to the immense hype surrounding it."

1152,Fallout,"Dual Wielding

I think it would be a pretty great feature that allows for interesting gameplay.  It would function similarly to the system in Skyrim. Not all weapons could be dual wieldable, like Missile Launchers or the Fat Man to prevent them from being overpowered. But most weapons would be. It's an interesting idea that I think could spice up combat and comes with a view trade offs. For example, if dual wielding guns you wouldn't be able to use iron-sights. For melee, you wouldn't be able to block as they block button would become the attack button for the secondary weapon.

Shields

 I also think dual wielding would work well if the next game implemented shields for melee combat. I find it strange that no one in the wasteland has thought to use something other than their weapon to block. Shields would also add another item for you to acquire and customize, they could also come in different varieties. A poorly made raider shield, an old police riot shield, an experimental energy shield, etc

Throwing Items

In the games you can already pick up objects that are lying around. After playing Half-Life 2 and Prey I would really like to be able to have an option to throw some of these items. You would be able to move barrels in front of people to blow them up, stack boxes to vault walls, move boxes that are blocking doorways or just fling items at NPCs. If an item is larger it could be heavier to pick up, requiring higher strength, similar to Prey's leverage system

Sliding

I'd love you to be able to hold the crouch key to be able to slide around. This could make combat more interesting and mobile. Maybe your sliding abilities could depend on your agility. Low agility results in sliding like in Far Cry 4, an animation you are stuck in but allows you to quickly move around. But sliding with high agility could allow you to slide like in Titanfall 2, with full aiming abilities. I understand that this is probably a lot of work to implement but it's something to think about. 

Dashing

If not sliding, maybe dashing? Preferably both. This seems a bit easier to add to the game. You double-tap the jump button and your character jolts forwards in the direction your were moving. This allows you to dodge bullets and can make melee a bit more fun. It might also add to more fun wasteland traversal. It could be tied to AP to prevent total abuse

Please let me know what you think of these ideas!",Some ideas I had for Fallout 5
1153,Fallout,,Where would you want the next fallout to take place?
1154,Fallout,"I've wanted to dive back into Fallout 4 for a while now, as I've been seeing a lot of cool new mods pop up on the nexus. But I also know that it's a big ole slippery slope that can suck you back in.

Like with a lot of fallout or bethesda games you can only play them so much before you get tired out and say ""Fuck it, I'm done.""

I've put 1000 hours into the game, and pretty much know it like the back of my hand, to the point where I can pretty much get to diamond city by like level 5. But the question is, do I really wanna subject myself to another 30 or 40 hours of going through the same old same old routine? Only because a couple of mods made me go ""Huh? Neat.""

There are far better games with far more interesting things to offer then just a couple of mods. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but honestly having beaten it so many times, do I really need to boot it up and go through the process for the bazillionth time? Suffer through the same old repeatable cutscenes and monotonous shooting galleries? Yeah there are mods that improve it, but that's not exactly the point.

If I have to install a mod to make the game more enjoyable, when some of the other games have way better gameplay loops it just makes me drift away from this game and enjoy them. And I also know that once re-open the game, the next thing I know I've sunken another 30 hours into the game because of a few cool mods.

No disrespect to the mod creators either, they do a great job of bringing life back to a dying game, but I also can't help but feel as though the charm I once held for the game has drastically fallen off, that it's just sitting there, collecting dust in my library because I'm bored with it.

I've tried new quest mods, gameplay overhaul mods, the whole nine yards, and they too tend to get boring because of how lackluster the game feels or that there isn't any mechanics that keep me coming back.

It really makes me appreciate New Vegas, and hell dozens of the other games I've played within the last month because of how much better they are then the game itself.

I know I kinda got off topic here, but I guess my ultimate point is, is there anything I can do to renew my love for the game, or least not get my life sucked back into game? Or if anyone else has felt this way?","I want to get back into Fallout 4, But I know it's a slippery slope"

Not to mention all the other things like making an energy and light source from scratch, building a fully functional teleporter from scratch and building carefully engineered defense systems, from scratch.

1181,Fallout,"I know that Fallout 5 is far off, probably a decade or so. Still, I've been replaying Fallout 4 lately and I've gotten more and more confident in Bethesda. Like a lot of Fallout fans, I quickly dismissed FO4 after the first playthrough due to the lack of narrative consequences, a bad dialogue system, a lackluster story trying to constantly take the cinematic approach and the majority of quests just boiling down to go to an area, kill enemies, pick up loot and return.

However after going for a survival run and being inspired by videos online and friends irl to try out various builds, I finally began to fall in love with the game. Don't get me wrong, the flaws listed above are still valid, in fact they're highlighted even more on subsequent playthroughs. Still, things I originally was hesitant to accept, like the leveling up system, settlement building and new VATS system have actually just suad me to love it. The perks offer utility rather than just number increases. It's so transparent that you can begin to plan ahead for what you want to pick up. The previous systems lacked transparency and if you've played New Vegas or FO3 with a mod that removes the level cap you'll quickly see that your character becomes a master at anything before hitting 40 or 50. While in FO4, I've gone for a VATS build and at Level 75 I'm extremely efficient and op in combat and stealth, yet my charisma sucks ass, I have little to no health so if I'm not quick on the trigger I'll get shredded to pieces and I lack so much intelligence that I can't craft anything and have to rely on what I scavenge. I have a specific build with strengths and weaknesses.

Speaking of VATS, the revamp makes VATS a lot more interesting. Finally the base stats have more of an effect on VATS. Previously all you needed was Agility for action points and Luck for a better chance at critical hits. Perception had no effect on VATS btw. I feel like Luck is way more useful as you get to decide when to initiate Critical Hits while in my New Vegas VATS build I felt like the lack of control over critical hits made me focus on building around base damage, but with perks like Critical Banker and Four Leaf Clover I feel like it's completely valid to build a character based around critical hits. That VATS slows down enemies instead of outright pausing the game adds a sense of urgency that forces you to act quickly and strategically. It prevents VATS from being a get out of jail free card. Also that enemies have specific weaknesses on their body parts so that you don't automatically aim for the head on every enemy goes a long way. (Like Deathclaws Belly, Radscorpion stinger, ghoul legs, Mr Handy thruster, power armor fusion core etc)

I feel like Fallout 4 has nailed a lot of the mechanics that makes Fallout unique. The whole ""Fallout 4 is a good game, just not a good Fallout game"" can die in a hole for what I care. Yes, Fallout should have a bigger emphasis on choice and dialogue, but to say that those 2 things are all that make up a Fallout game would be selling the game short.

So Fallout 5 and why I'm confident. The Far Harbor DLC for FO4 shows that Bethesda is capable of writing interesting quests with good dialogue as the main quest of Far Harbor is basically the main quest of FO4, only 10 times better. Fallout 76 shows that they have learned from the negative feedback that they got regarding the dialogue system and actually, get this, added dialogue with skill checks, more than just 4 options, charisma isn't the only stat with checks and it's not percentage based. Sound awfully a lot like New Vegas, and you're right, it's pretty much the same. So that Bethesda is actually adopting more mechanics from New Vegas is a good sign of them taking the best from both worlds. The reputation system, while not as deep as New Vegas, returns in 76. Again, best from both worlds. Lastly addition from New Vegas that Bethesda actually improved upon in my opinion are mutations. You now get mutations with specific trade off perks like ""Increased critical damage and perception, but -4 strength"" from radiation. And with the radiation system from FO4 you're trading your max hp to get a mutation that can hopefully benefit your build.

With FO4 as a starting point, taking the dialogue system from NV and 76, the reputation system from NV, the mutations system from 76 and quest design from NV and Far Harbor, I think this game having a chance of being one of the best of the franchise is a no brainer. Also, not saying it's likely what so ever, since Microsoft owns both Bethesda and Obsidian we might get a chance to have both studios work on the same title. Even though a lot of the people that worked on NV has left Obsidian, I still think Bethesda's immaculate world building and great core mechanics is a good match with Obsidians philosophy on quest design and dialogue. Anyways that's my semi essay on why Fallout 5 is a game I'm already hyped for even though it's not even confirmed that it's being worked on. What do you guys think? Any mechanics that you feel would fit FO5 that I haven't mentioned yet?","For the first time in any franchise, I feel a sequel is going to automatically be the best game in the franchise."
1182,Fallout,"Hi all, as I said in the title I want to enter this series because I hear great things from it, but I cant decide between Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 4: From what the general public says, New Vegas seems deeper and with a greater story than Fallout 4, but then I check Metacritic and the second one is a bit more highly valued by the critics.

For reference, I dont really care about combat, I just want to experience a good story so my instinct tells me to try New Vegas first, but I figured you guys would know better.

1183,Fallout,"jesus i am horrible at this game, i can't exactly tell why i am, but i am. I can't say something like ""oh, i'm bad in shooting"" or ""oh, i'm bad at looting items"", i can't point a thing to tell you exactly why i am bad, but i am. You know that feeling when you are only 8 years old and you're playing minecraft survival, and the only thing you can do is a dirt house without even a door and you know that you are objectively bad at this game, and you feel completely lost in the enormous world and you feel like the game offers you so plenty things to do, but because a lack of skill you can't take those things. It is like there is a relationship of dominance between me and New Vegas, but just like a CSGO pro-player domains CSGO, i feel the opposite with New Vegas, i feel like the game domains me, when i'm playing it, there is almost no moment where i feel like i'm in control of anything. And the funniest part is that i FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME, the whole game seems to be so damn great to me, i have played 25 hours of it, and everything i hear about the game makes me want to play more and more, but i can't, i can't properly enjoy all the things the game has to offer me because i feel lost in that enormous world, therefore, i fucking suck at this game.

btw this is not a big deal, it's just a silly thing that came up in my mind and i felt that it would be cool to share this with you guys. I'll keep playing the game tho",i fucking sucks playing new vegas
1184,Fallout,,Would you like to finally see Area 51?
1185,Fallout,"The Brotherhood of Steel.

The Institute.

The Railroad.

All these factions with huge influence on world simply crumble to dust. And if BoS can still be somehow restored from deficiencies, and Railroad may still have agents in different places, then Institute is completely destroyed and in most stupid way. And Railroad should self-destruct, because there is no need for it anymore if there is no Institute.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, the Minutes are almost always allies. Is this not a hint that, according to the canon, only they will be responsible for the destruction of the threats of the Commonwealth?

Also, last DLC bothers me. Is this not a hint, that plot end SS became raider and took over the Commonwealth? It would be silly. As an example, dovahkiin in the Dawnguard trailer became a vampire. But that doesn't matter because of the Dragonborn ending. Whereas main plot of Fallout 4 can be a line, that shows how unprepared for wasteland human lives only hope, and after hope collapses remains only emptiness and madness. Then becoming a violent raider is pretty logical.",Are you also worried that all major Fallout factions are being destroyed in F4?

Bandits will detect me sneaking through a building at night in thick fog, is there any way to get my companions to use this same type of AI like every other NPC in the game?",How to use companions?
1189,Fallout,"So, good morning everyone, before I ask you anything I'm gonna tell you about a few things,

I've bought Fallout 4 since day one, and started playing in survival mode since in came out. I have something like a 1000 hours or so in this game. I've run quite a lot of different builds; Stealth Sniper, Melee VATS/Melee PA, Charisma/Int, and personally the one I like the most, the Heavy drug user with automatic weapons.

I mean, past a certain a level, in my experience, you can either Blitz a Mirelurk Queen, or you can spam  her death high on jet while listening to classical radio. Having a semi auto rifle seems awkward (yes there is the Gauss Rifle, but it is so slow, and the ammo is heavy, rare and epensive.)

So here I am today, started watching MATN YOLO playthrough, which gave me a Fallout 4 urge. I don't like his build so much, as I don't enjoy crouching all the time. I haven't played the game for a few years, and I really want to finish the main quest line this time, even if it's after hours of wandering.

I've been tinkering a lot with my SPECIAL stats and my perks. I'm the kind of guy who loves min/maxing and here is what I came with:

My new character is currently level 13: With Locksmith, Demolition Expert, Lone Wanderer, Hacker and Sneak. I didn't take Commando yet, because at that level you don't get much good auto weapons, and I don't plan on taking any crafting skills. I've been playing with them a lot, and in the end I find them too good. I like gimping myself, I like the struggle in the beginning of the game. I just run with Justice, a 10mm autopistol and the Hunting rifle dropped by a gunner near Tenpine Bluffs. My stats right now are :

S-4 (5 with Special book) and up to 6 with the bobblehead, simply for Strong Back, carry weight is a thing, and having to run around every half hour to base just to put my junk in my settlement kinda bores me. I might even go for the Hip fire perk at some point.

P-4 (5 with bobblehead) Demolition Expert, there is no debate on this perk, the only question is, should I keep it a level 2 or try to get it up to 4

E-4 (5 with bobblehead) for Aquaboy, fearing the smallest puddle is no fun. Just wondering if I should go for Adamantium Skeleton because breaking a limb mid fight s\*cks. And I need your opinion on Chem Resistant. And I still haven't tried the Life Giver perk..

C-5 (6 with bobblehead) for Local Leader, now in the past, I've been messing quite a bit with settlements, but at some point these settlers piss me off, and I don't like leveling so much while building, only to venture outside to get my face ripped because I'm undergeared. I might get into it, or not, just having the choice without having to invest in this stat is enough for me, plus, I like speech checks.

I-6 (7 with bobblehead) for Chemist, which is for me, one of the best perk in the game. Should I go up to 8 for Robotic Experts? And should I take Medic? What about Scrapper? Is it useful in a wandering run?

A-4 (5 with bobblehead) for Action Boy, maybe I should go for Ninja? 

L -1(2 with bobblehead) I don't like VATS, I know it's powerful, but it can get buggy, and buggy things kill you in this game, I feel like drugs helps a lot more in these ""oh sh\*t"" moments. Might go up to 6 for Better Criticals, for those asking, I'm not planning on taking Idiot Savant early, because I really think leveling too fast can do you great harm.

So, here are more questions:

Should I go for armorer or should I wait for when I meet the RailRoad? Should I go for Lead Belly, because in my experience, Purified Water can become heavy, and drug usage is water consumming, I've been thinking about a build where I could be thirsty all the time for the Int debuff, which would help Idiot Savant to proc, but I might keep that for later, when leveling becomes quite long.

I'm clearing Corvega right now, with no weapon buff perks except Demo Expert, it's been quite fun. But I'm starting to feel the ghouls beefier, and Raider Scums and Psychos are starting to spawn, so it might be time for me to get my hands on damage perks. But now, where can I find a decent auto weapon without going too much south? (I'm not going to buy Spray'n'Pray right now, it might be overkill)? I was thinking about something like an autoPipe smg, with drum mags, if there is a guaranteed spawn for that.

I'm really not sure about where I should be heading next, if some of you can give me some advices on that. Thank you for reading, hope I get some advices!","Need some advices on my survival playthrough (Drugs are fun, so are auto weapons )"

Q: ""I Dont wanna be a team member but i wanna follow the project""  
A: Feel free to join we could always use the support!

Q: ""If i wanna be a Dev whats next?""  
A:Well that's where the fun starts! So if you've worked on something before (Like a modded character or art a game you coded ect) send me the project.

Q: ""Dont you need permission from Bethesda before making the fan game?""  
A: I plan on asking and showing concepts to Bethesda about this game hopefully that means that ill be favorable.

Q: ""Why Australia?/Why not another USA Sate?""

My last play through was New Vegas, so that’s off the table. My options really are 3 and 4. 

3 has a larger nostalgia factor for me considering it was my first RPG and first Fallout. I actually love the fire fights and combat mechanics in 3 (unpopular opinion). But, with all that said, it means I’ve played it soo much more than any other one.

4 is fun with the combat and building mechanics, but it doesn’t have the same nostalgia factor that 3 has for me. Although, I vividly remember the hype of it being announced and then dropping on a cold November day. 

So, since I can’t decide, I want anyone who reads this to decide for me. I guess the game with the most upvotes/comments will be the one.

1219,Fallout,"Many people will praise New Vegas for having the Courier be ""non-predetermined"", as if that's a bad thing and also as if that's true.

For starters, the Courier is predetermined. The opening states how they're a courier and works with the Mojave Express. It's predetermined you get ambushed and shot in the head. If one wants to get real nitpicky/technical, there are heaps of traits/characteristics in the dialogue trees. The Courier also is further predetermined in the DLC, Lonesome Road. Stating you walked to and fro countless times, helped the NCR countless times as a freelance courier, and helped build a settlement and accidentally set if off.

Again, none of this is truly bad. Predetermined traits/characteristics are necessary, especially for the plot. What would New Vegas look like if you didn't get shot and just got told ""go find Benny""? Or what would Fallout 1 look like if you were just told ""go find the water chip"" and just - weren't given the part of being from a Vault?

Predetermined characteristics/characters aren't bad. I don't get why many people act like it is and I certainly don't get why people act like the Courier isn't.

Now for explaining the ""why predetermined characters aren't bad"", why does the Vault Dweller care about the water chip and super mutant threat? Why does the Chosen One seek out a G.E.C.K.? Why does the Lone Wanderer help start Project Purity? All these questions have an answer. All these questions are a part of the plot. Predetermined Vault Dweller cares to find a water chip because the Vault is their home. The predetermined Chosen One seeks out a G.E.C.K. because their family is in trouble. Predetermined Lone Wanderer starts Project Purity because their dad worked on it and further sacrificed himself for it.

But why does the Courier care about the Dam/Mojave? What ties them to it? Some have said the platinum chip. But only one guy needs it, House. Caesar wants it but he doesn't need it. But none of these are reasons why the Courier cares about the Dam/Mojave. They don't live in the Mojave, no faction benefits or opposes them on their search for Benny, the war isn't going to affect them. This is how the Courier being non-predetermined hurts to narrative of Fallout: New Vegas. If you ask why, you don't get an answer. The Courier gets no real benefit for fighting at the Dam because it doesn't affect their well-being or anything at all. Heck it's predetermined that the Courier worked with the NCR in the past, so why would they suddenly join the Legion or House?",The Courier is Predetermined and Why Predetermined Characters Aren't Bad

Part 1

You have just seen father, who has just passed away. Now you are father to the institute. Who knew that your son was going to be the leader of the institute? Now you were general of the minutemen, elder of the brotherhood, director of the railroad and father to the institute. You now had control of the commonwealth. It is weird, isn’t it? Power? The feeling of every action being yours to do without consequence? You knew what you had to do though. Bring them together. All of the factions. You decide to bring them all together in Boston to completely meet each other. You stood on top of a building while you watched them all gather together and talk to each other, each faction giving each other dirty looks. You decide to speak. “Hello, I’ve gathered you all here today to announce some news that might come as an unpleasant surprise to you, but it is the only way to restore the commonwealth. I’m going to create a new faction. A super faction, capable of ruling the commonwealth.” To you amazement, they all looked at each other, and just said “ok.” 

You needed a name. A name for this new, powerful army. Maybe Jackabombs? No, cringe and sounds like a raider gang. Parryflappers? No, what the hell? BlueHeads?... I kind of like that. Makes us sound powerful, but not like a bunch of murderers. Makes us sound like heroes. Huh.

# CHAPTER 1:

This story takes place in the northern Middle of USA(Basically entire Iowa, Illinois and Missouri + parts of Nebraska, Oklahoma, Kansas, Tennessee, Indiana, Wisconsin and a bit of S. Dakota) 10 years after The Courier fend off the onslaught of Caesar's legion, sent Oliver back to NCR and got rid off Benny in the name of House.

[You start in Vault 66](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMkWkNuxFAA&amp;list=PLC0C2A6BCA6040BC8&amp;index=7) somewhere near Omaha, Nebraska. Your vault is no longer active due to mass dehydration caused by unknown cause. The closest vault you know is Vault 54 somewhere in Kansas, however if you are around 25km away from Topeka(Kansas) by north, you will meet with the main antagonists of the story:

**The New America,** These guys are basically more tolerant version of The Enclave lead by Super Mutant King Lawrence Charlie Dexter, or Dexey as he likes to be called. The only survivor of explosion in Mariposa Base back in Fallout 1. Dexey sends his party of warriors lead by General to some town called [""Orimosa"", and the party will murder the local town because local ranger disagreed with the general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZctTNwrjHA&amp;list=PLC0C2A6BCA6040BC8&amp;index=9) Quentin Mansion, so the general used his pack of Ghoul warriors to murder the men, force families to watch how other ghouls eat their children alive while being shot. You witness a family hiding in dumpster that is burned by the Angels, but then captain will say to you **""You may not be from this town, but remember to spread message about great Chieftain to the world, so that your home doesnt end up like this""** and then will go back to General. If you chose to ask General about his reasons, he will tell you: **""We The New America are the only path to make civilization in wasteland. WARRIORS OF NEW AMERICA, WE WILL SHOW THESE PEOPLE WHAT IS OUR CAPITAL MADE OF!""**.

# CHAPTER 2:

You witness the [beauty of rebuilt Overland Park and vault 90 inside Kansas city center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzHQ7sCBlrQ&amp;list=PLE9B1B519657DCF3E&amp;index=6), but you will also notice the slavery allowed on ""Enemies of The New America"" which are sold to Caesar's legion. And then you will meet King Lawrence the 1rst or King Dexey as he suggests you to, who will offer you a chance of service in his army. If you say no, he will imprison you and tell you ""You want freedom? Fight for it!"" and then you have to defeat Deathclaw. If you do, he will tell you ""You earned freedom through your skills, now go and if you show up again without asking for recruitment, you will be next on the menu!"". Then you wander off to remains of former Kansas city, and you will see only bones and scavengers that try to eat them, but are afraid of New American soldiers. If you wander east to shores of Missouri outside of Kansas city, you will meet with a bunch of friendly gangsters called ""Dark Angels"", who will reveal the secrets of the King Dexey: He hides the fact that hes a cannibal, He plans to reduce most of the US population from 100% to 49% because he wants to create ""Stronger Americans"" with a bit of an FEV, and also that he is disloyal to other factions, and you have to cure the virus their leader Joseph Price. If you do that, he will grant you the with the map to Vault 54. If you get there, you will learn about Cyborgs and their hatred for King Dexey that caused 7 month war, in which Cyborgs won.

# CHAPTER 3:

Y[ou get an option to breach into the secret treasure of Vault 54, disappointingly you dont discover anything valuable, besides the fact that Cyborgs are basically hostage cult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7l_em3nrs&amp;list=PLOJyW97d5rB235R1R5W_tWpLdNk-l9G52&amp;index=4), that imprisons foreigners and sacrifices them to the Great Vault Lord. If you have any chance of not leaving any tracks, you would get out without problem, but if they found about your breach, you will have to resort to either diplomacy or battle","[Post from guy, who didnt joined the sub but love the franchise] My story for tabletop RPG Fallout(Not finished, your suggestions needed)"

1277,Fallout,"Before everyone suggests, I have taken a good look at older fallout games, and despite being a 30+ boomer, I dont really feel the mood to go and learn older game mechanics right now. I am already a big fan of Josh Sawyers newer games, so when I heard about New Vegas, I really do want to play it... someday.

For now, I think I am just in the mood for a more modern gun based rpg. I come from looter shooter games, but I wanted to take a step back and feel the rpg (mechanically) that a single player game has.

So my question is, for single player enjoyment overall (inlcuding story beats) should I start with Fallout 4 or 76? If I like the world, Im sure ill go back and work my way through the older ones.

Thank you!",First Fallout Game? (FO4 or FO76?)
1278,Fallout,"The game goes out of its way to frame the Bitter Springs Massacre as a big tragedy and the Khans as victims of NCR incompetence and/or maliciousness. Characters seem to ignore that the Khans brought it on themselves by attacking the NCR as soon as they showed up. And from what I gathered the NCR did attempt to make them stop before Bitter Springs but Papa Khan just blew it off and assumed the NCR wouldn't be able to stop them. 

While I can agree that the innocents of the Khans didn't deserve it the game doesn't seem to acknowledge that the Khans did the same thing. Papa Khan *brags* about how the NCR couldn't stop their raids, which presumably included killing innocents as well. But when the NCR does the same thing it's an unforgiveable crime and these hypocritical, raiding pricks have the gall to whine if the NCR and Kings make peace by claiming that the NCR didn't extend them that same offer before Bitter Springs. 

Not only that but when the Followers tried to help them they decided to spit in their face by becoming drug dealers and supplying the fiends in order to harass the NCR, which leads to a lot of death and suffering to not just the NCR but also the residents of New Vegas. Not to mention their deal with the Legion supposedly includes being given free raiding rights through all of western New Vegas, shpwing that at their core they're still just a bunch of glorified bandits. 

And yet despite all this the game tries to frame the Khan Empire ending as positive, which is just...off. NOTHING they do indicates that these bastards would ever make good city builders and yet the ending where you give them books of the Mongols - who were totally good examples to follow, right? - somehow leads to a good ending. I call bullshit. 

I dunno, maybe it's just me but it feels super weird that the game tries super hard to make you sympathize with the glorified raider drug dealers. Or when Papa Khan brags about raiding NCR caravans and homes there's no dialogue option to say anything on it. The game literally allows you to threaten Caesar while you're in the heart of his camp so calling the Khans on  their hypocrisy at the cost of making them hostile should also be there, right?",Am I the only one who really doesn't like the Great Khans and thinks their great empire ending is bs?

But in FO4, many of the enemies don’t beeline. I especially like the Radscorpion and Ghoul behavior.

Quote:

""We also need more minor factions as well. Your Boomers, Khans, Powder Gangers...etc.

I thought about this while playing Fallout 4, and doing the silver shroud quest, wouldn’t it be great to have a minor faction of comic book fans turned vigilantes? You have the silver shroud, you have the random encounter with a Manta Man vigilante, there’s a Grognak costume and weapon that could have easily been a part of a quest, maybe a friendly super mutant who wants to be like Grognak? Perhaps you could find the original actress for the Mistress of Mystery that’s talked about in the Hubris Comics terminals as a ghoul.

Best part would be that since they’re a minor faction they could probably work with the different main factions. Perhaps they can be a special unit in the Minutemen or BoS. Or a fantastic distraction for the Railroad to take advantage of. Or, maybe you could convince them to work for the institute, in exchange for the cybernetics that Kellogg got, making them “real” superheroes, and bring comics back into print so that they can experience new adventures of their favorite heroes based on their own deeds.""",A great idea for a new faction in Fallout 5.
1339,Fallout," I know, I know, the Institute has done a lot of evil things. And in any other circumstances I would agree that the Institute needs to be destroyed. However, here you (the SS) are game-changing factor. If you side with the Institute and the Minutemen, you become leader of both. That's right, the General of the Commonwealth Minutemen literally becomes the absolute ruler of the Institute. That means that if your character is a morally good one, then the Institute stops being an evil boogeyman and it gets transformed into the ultimate force of good for the people of the Commonwealth. From then on, you decide where the Institute's resources will go to, you can free the synths, distribute technology with all the citizens of the CW, etc. \*You\* become the Institute and can command it as you will. The Institute is not evil in itself, it is like a tool, like a hammer, whoever wields it can either use it to do evil (kill people) or to do good (build stuff), you get my point? So, as good as the Minutemen get (they're objectively the good guys, pure good), they're not very capable of rebuilding humanity's future. The Institute, in good hands, can be a force of pure good as well, with the difference that they're capable of achieving technological wonders. And you know they'll be up to doing good stuff because the General of the Minutemen (you) will be ruling over them. From then on, you can do only good using the Institute's resources.

2022 starfield 
2023 avowed 
2024 Fable 4
2025 elder scrolls 6
2026  fallout 5.

Microsoft big rpg are elder scrolls, fallout, fable and avowed(obsidens rpg)  we know they wouldn't them to compete with each other and dlc lasts about 6 months.

1343,Fallout,"Citizens of the outer Vegas region with assistance from The Followers of the Apocalypse via Tom Anderson have managed to teach its residents agriculture and form a farmers Co-Op with basic refrigeration that is now beginning to do more than just break even in its ventures and Westsiders have gone so far as to organize a militia and raise defensive walls to deter raids by the Fiends.

When the NCR took control of the waterworks and began to sell it at an expensive rate bringing the issue of reliable clean water to light Anderson rigged one of the automatic pumps to periodically divert water into the North Cistern to provide an answer for their independence.

Locals grow enough produce to feed themselves and export to other parties while North Vegas a smaller quadrant of the area survive on trade exchanging protection from fiends and critters in the sewers that would endanger merchants, gamblers, and NCR citizens.

(though their community prides themselves on their nack for survival and views them as soft)

All together, it seems that mankind finds a way with or without a centralized government. 

Diverting the power from Helios One to Freemont/Westside giving them electricity, easing tension between the Kings and NCR as well as getting rid of those scumbags St. James and Dermot only makes the future look even more promising.",Upon further observation I'm very impressed with the communities both Westside and North Vegas have created without help from the NCR.

Bethesda is making Starfield, and then Elder Scrolls 6, and then maybe Fallout 5. The weird thing to me is that nobody has changed their tune since the Microsoft acquisition. 

They definitely haven't been shy about leaning into Fallout in their marketing. The very first image in [the video they released about the acquisition ](https://youtu.be/Wqg6nKpsZMI) is Fallout. Obviously you can't read too much into that but the biggest thing to me is that Microsoft created a [whole new company named ""Vault"".](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-creating-new-company-vault-to-complete-zenimax-bethesda-deal) If they're rebranding all of Zenimax to line it up with the Fallout franchise it feels like they see money there and why would they wait a decade to cash in on that? They have more resources now to throw at it to make more content in the universe happen sooner.

Since most reflex/red dot sights would have probably been destroyed by the nuclear explosion, finding one would be rather difficult. Making one would be quite difficult as well as you must understand how they work and have the specific parts. So making an improvised optic would be a smart idea.

The design of the pipe reflex is very crude, as it is a hollow metal tube with a screw through either sideu. However, by tightening one screw and backing ot the other, you could effectively zero the scope to account for wind. The scope could be zeored for left or right winds.

FNV is in an interesting and complex creative position when it comes to its franchise - it follows the vision laid out by F1 and F2 that's inherently at odds with Bethesda's F3 and F4 vision. Even metaphorically it differs, the main metaphor being Old World Blues. Bethesda's vision of the Blues is nostalgic wonder that you could die for, while the Interplay/Obsidian vision says that the reason you die for it is because it murders you. 

Hbomberguy, the thought criminal, cleverly pointed out in a jokingly way the difference between F3's Born to Die narrative metaphor and FNV's Died to Live narrative metaphor. In F3, you die to literally purify the land in hopes of returning the world to its rightfully balanced place where it isn't irradiated (I can't believe it's not a Christ allegory!). In FNV, you get shot in the and buried in an unmarked grave for carrying an ancient artifact of the old world, only to be selected by Fate, Destiny, Obsidian, Josh Sawyer, whatever you want to call it, to rise from your grave and break the stalemate of the universe. In a way the contradiction has been reversed: F3 wants you to die for the greater life of the world, and FNV is already on the phone with Charon about rescheduling your trip down the Styx.

If you've read literary theory, you may have come across Northrop Frye and his book *The Anatomy of Criticism*. His mission in it is to establish a science for literary criticism that didn't really stick, though a lot of its DNA can somewhat be found in today's conversations about Genre. As it relates to FNV's opening, I think Frye's archetypal modes of stories gives a pretty interesting view of its metaphors and how it constructs its meanings.

Without going too deep, Frye says that every story can be categorized under 4 modes: Comedy, Romance, Tragedy, and Irony. These 4 modes then are split into 6 phases each, with each of them sharing half their phases with another. For instance, Romance and Tragedy both begin with a hero's mythic birth (in FNV's case, ironically rising from the grave). If you've read anything about the Hero's journey, this may sound familiar. Comedy and Irony, in contrast, both begin with an immersion into the story world, in this instance being New Vegas, the Mojave, and all its players. 

You can probably tell form FNV's opening that its balancing all 4 modes, and that's appropriate. Because FNV is a an RPG with cOnSeqUENTial storytelling, it can mold itself under any of the phases of any of the modes, gravitating towards certain modes depending on your chosen route. Independence for instance is very comedic in nature (if good karma) because it begins by questioning the social world around Courier 6 and proceeds to obliterate it for the birth of a brave new world, part 2. 

That brave new world analogy, which is actually said by Julie Farkas in the game in Freeside, is interesting with how it operates in Fallout. Naturally, all apocalypse media suggests a brave new world, from *The Postman* to *Mad Max*. *Mad Max* is particularly relevant for the quote in the second movie about Max ""living off of the corpse of the old world,"" and *The Postman* is basically the goofy prototype for FNV (the novel, not the movie. Fuck the movie). 

Anyway, the point here is that with F1, we see the birth of the brave new world, and in F2 we see it grow up. F3 repeats it again because it's busy referencing its predecessors, and FNV evolves from its predecessors by saying that the brave new world is no longer brave nor new. The NCR are repeating the same mistakes as the country its replicating, and the Legion are cosplaying the Romans with a nod towards *Mad Max*. Meanwhile, a neoliberal billionaire has risen from the grave and plans to bring the old world back with him. FNV's world is one that's trapped in a loop of itself, a stuttering record player, and Courier 6 has to decide if they like the blues or not.

Another element of Frye that begins developing from the opening that becomes more present as the game continues is his archetypical mythoi. As per his premise of every story having moralizing politics in it, Frye has it that every story presents 2 (kind of 2 and a half) metaphorical realms representing its morals, beliefs, preferences, ideals, etc. Frye is kind of in love with *The Divine Comedy*, so the structure is based on Dante's mythology. At the tope is the upper realm, the ideal place of good and orderly things, while down below is the lower demonic realm of chaos and destruction and bad stuff, according the author that is. In between is the more complicated material realm things aren't so straight forward. 

When you start the game, you know Courier 6 is going to New Vegas. It screams at you from the distance at night when looking from the Goodsprings cemetery. New Vegas is that mythic upper realm, marked by its alien, old world lights. It suggests that second brave new world (ironically built on the old old world), and its god/father figure Mr. House it surreptitiously calling out to you.

That seems counter to what the upper realm is sounds like, and another point about the upper realm is that it is often hypocritical, lying to you, lying to itself. Vegas's lights ain't nothing but flickering taillights meant to run you off the road. House, as Vegas's representative god-king, doesn't care about your humanity, he cares about your knees, which you are currently not on right now. Courier 6 doesn't know that yet, but they can begin to suspect if you can intuit the metaphors in front of you.

\--

I'm writing these from week to week, probably on Fridays. I don't really mid if no one reads these - I more so just want to give form to my dumb abstract thoughts. I'm actually at Novac right now, but my next entry is probably going to be on Goodsprings, Primm, and the Powder Gangers. There are some neat things going there about pro-social and anti-social beliefs going on there that I don't see remarked on often.

1407,Fallout,"I have not played 1, 2, or 76, so I can’t give feedback for those. I am yet to play broken steel and the Pitt too, so let me know about those in the comments. Well start from best to worst

1. Far harbor. Enough said. But really, the game gives you that feel that you’re on this sparsely habited island in the middle of a huge conflict. It gives you the scary vibe, but also a vibe of hope.

2. This might be controversial, but operation anchorage. I loved the story (although I do complain that it meant jack shit in the grand scheme of things). I love the way you have to go from place to place, and it feels like a battlefield V war story. 

3. Honest hearts. Joshua graham is one of the best written characters in all of Bethesda history. I also love the Native American dude (can’t remember his name it’s like salt upon wounds or something). I love traveling through Zion, completing the mission assigned to me because it’s crazy fun. But sometimes it gets kinda boring, and a drag along.

4. Lonesome road. Controversial again, but there was so much lore crammed into the game, and lore is what Bethesda does best. (Or does good at all lol /s). It was boring just you and Ulysses, so that’s why it’s not higher. It also kinda feels like you’re just walking to Ulysses the whole time. 

5. Nuka World. Gage is really the only great part about it. It’s basically minutemen quest line but evil. Kind ok I guess.

6. Vault workshop. Meh. At least it has a story. 
Added a few neat items.

7. Old world blues. Why am I not putting it higher? This is old world blues to me: some high off their asses robot scientists talk to you for 10 minutes to get you to do some random shit bc there’s this annoying other robot. Really boring and forgettable to me.

8. Gun runners arsenal. They kept me stacked up on ammo and decent gear for the game so good I guess. 

9. Wasteland workshop. What can I say, it’s just a workshop.

10. Contraptions workshop. 8 and 9 are virtually interchangeable, and a don’t remember which ones which a lot of the time.

11. Dead money. What?? You were kidnapped by some ex-brotherhood guy for following some radio signal, and now you have to rob a casino with millions of dollars worth of gold without a choice with invincible ghosts and holograms. Oh, and did I mention they take your stuff, and if you attempt to have free will, you either explode or choke to death on red fog.

Think about it if you side with the railroad sure the synths are free, but the wasteland is more chaotic and raiders could be more rampant, if you side with the minutemen there are less raiders and the synths are free.

1430,Fallout,"Obviously, in game it’s presented as pure evil.

In my opinion, the Institute are a group of really good people, under really bad leadership.

But if you were leader of the institute, you could stop the Gen 3 synths even being made, you could treat them as humans and only produce Gen 1s and 2s. This would appease a lot of people.

You have access to technology better than pre-war, it’s the only place in any fallout game that is arguably better than places pre-war. It has the cure to the FEV virus, and could find many more cures. It has synthetic life which could be added back to the commonwealth, synthetic plants and grass, and could re-add greenery to the area.

It also has teleportation and so could make travel between places easily and safe, and could make the transport of goods easy. It would be such a waste, to waste all of this technology, and arguably the most technologically advanced faction in any fallout game.

Especially because you are general of the minutemen, an alliance could exist, and the sole survivor could turn the institute from an evil, kidnapping, shadow, into the shining light of the commonwealth.","Under the right leadership, surely the Institute would be the commonwealths best hope."

1472,Fallout,"Far Cry 5 is the same game in term of having many gun fights in wide open spaces.

In Fallout 4 the ballistics weapons are hitscan (I think laser weapons as well).  Only plasma has bullet modeling.

Fallout is already a much more interactive game than Far Cry 5 but the lack of ballistics modeling is disappointing and takes the fun out of sniping and using rifles at range.  There are soo many moments of these, at the gunners overpass for example, thicket excavations.

In Far Cry 5, even with a p226, you can actually see your bullets curve and drop.  And the hit is not instant - it’s the same as at an actual outdoor range. 

At 50 yards, it takes several moments before the bullet actually impacts, especially slow handgun rounds.  This makes gunfights much more exciting - the scrambles for a hill, or a bunker, or beachhead - they actually feel like war.  

So after several hours of Far Cry 5 or New Dawn, gunplay in Fallout falls far short, in my opinion.  I hope they have real ballistics physics modeling in the next game.",Suggestion - real time bullet modeling

It would be very interesting gameplay - players would have to come up with ways to get something from high places.

1475,Fallout,"If Bethesda is smart they won't pick Chicago as the place setting for Fallout 5. It's not that Chicago is a bad idea for a game setting.

The only reason why Bethesda should not go for Chicago is because it is now predictable. 
Bethesda can't afford another flop and still make Fallout while not making Tim Cain loyalists at least a little curious.
Tim Cain is the original creator of Fallout who 2.5 years ago made a statement by creating Outer Worlds. 
Outer Worlds is a spiritual successor to Fallout as was Fallout a spiritual successor to Wasteland (also created by Interplay.) Outer Worlds was received warmly as a relief and if I read it right this was a message to Bethesda.
Outer Worlds was a response to the Bethesda's creation of Fallout 76 (and partly Fallout 4) which was the last straw for many Fallout lovers. Bethesda knew it was following the Fortnight/battle royale bandwagon when it created Fallout 76, hoping it would be a cash cow for developing the Elder Scrolls franchise.
If Bethesda wants to regain the lost hopes and dreams of thousands of Fallout fans, they will make Fallout 5 an answer upon this crucible.

If Fallout 5 is to be a success Bethesda will make it something completely new yet referencing original lore at every turn. Everything must be deliberate, ultimate and as awe inspiring as Fallout was in 1997 when it won best RPG of the year.

Please join me in my next article on my predictions for what Fallout.
What it was, what it has become. 
What Fallout 5 needs to achieve not only as an honerable accreditation to the franchise but how it could stand alone as one of the best games ever made.

Knowing what has transpired already makes me sceptical of the future success for the series while Bethesda takes helm. 

Yet these are my contribution on the matter.

The matter I'm bringing up is bringing Boone along as a companion.

1496,Fallout,,Lore Masters?
1497,Fallout,[deleted],I love fallout but I feel fallout 3 is it's just not my favourite
1498,Fallout,"This is 100% just a fun theory I came up with earlier today while commenting on a YouTube video. I am not a loremaster. I have not played through every single game. I just saw a video about the Fallout world outside of the United States and had a neat idea, so I'm sharing it.

(Already making an edit before I post: this little theory ballooned into a larger theory that I kinda want to write more about now. If you take the time to read the whole thing, I think you'll be entertained.)

To me, one of the biggest questions of the series is why Vault-Tec created the vaults to run social, psychological, and science related experiments on people for hundreds of years. This becomes a bigger question when you realize that it'd be pretty useless information if the entire world was destroyed. Why would Vault-Tec design all of these vaults and, as the some lore suggests, may have began the Great War if they would be destroyed in the process?

Now, there's a plethora of answers to this, and this is just my own theory just for fun, but I think a common argument would be ""Well, Vault-Tec built vaults, so they probably lived in the vaults too."" I like that idea a lot, and when I was prompted by a YouTube video about the Fallout world outside of America, I came up with this: the Great War didn't affect the Old World. Bear with me.

As per Ron Perlman's beautiful narration of Fallout 1, the pre-War world was (mostly) composed of the territories taken over by the United States, bickering nation-states in Europe, and the Soviets and Chinese. Tensions were high everywhere, and at a drop of a hat the world could end. At least, as far as we are told in the games. While I will not contest Perlman's narration, my theory is kinda built around the concept that tensions weren't as high between the Old World countries as they were between the Old World and the New World continents. Obviously the European Union and the United Nations were disbanded and there were some tensions between Europe and the communists eastward, but China and Russia were more focused on the Americas.

So in the decades leading up to the Great War, a group of intellectuals, entrepreneurs, businessmen, and scientists form a group bent on gathering information that will help humanity survive the inevitable destruction of the world. They originally come up with the idea of the vault system and decide to begin the construction in the United States as it would have access to the materials required to build the vaults. Along the way, some bickering begins between the project managers as construction begins. Obvious problems come up, like how they are going to get the data from the vaults, how they are going to get volunteers, etc. Then, questionable ethics come up. Some of the more morally righteous leaders of the organization criticize some of the puzzling experiment choices, such as Vault 34's violent nature.

The quarreling bleeds into all facets of the project. More and more support is gained for the unethical vaults. Soon, members of the project begin to form bickering groups and all are forced to join sides in the debate. Most of the supporters for the cruel experiments are financial backers and politicians. At the tipping point of the debate, one of the members of the board of the project announces that the financial backers are leaving the project and all of their property and assets will be reorganized into a corporation called Vault-Tec. The newly established Vault-Tec would go on to serve for the benefit of humanity in the long run, effectively turning the vault system into a widespread experiment spanning the entire United States from coast to coast. As decades pass and the project nears completion, the tensions between the U.S. and China escalate faster than Vault-Tec anticipated and they realize that war is coming soon, and the United States may be the first to fall.

As the day of war comes, Vault-Tec's aristocracy, made from trustees, backers, politicians, and scientists, flee the nation to make a gamble. They set up a base of operations in Europe and start to influence the politics of Europe. Through the company, not only is protection from nuclear winter promised, but some of the riches of the United States' resources are also brought to the continent. The independent nation-states' governments begin to take bribes and offers of sustained protection. They unofficially join the company, hoping to outlast the common populace in the promised vaults. Both the European nations and Vault-Tec begin contacting China to sign a treaty between the continents. Vault-Tec plots that, instead of China attacking the United States and getting destroyed entirely, they move their operations out of China and into the near-empty regions of the Middle East and Western Russia. This mass evasion move coupled with Vault-Tec's access to their experiments' results and data would allow for the Old World to survive even if most of it is destroyed. As long as the Chinese and European governments keep Vault-Tec protected and safe, they can survive the Great War.

So it ends that the agreements are made, and China begins to move into western territory. Before they can properly settle into Eastern Europe and the Middle East, Vault-Tec utilizes a missile silo they built into one of the northernmost vaults in the annexed territory of Canada to attack the U.S. This prematurely begins the Great War. The U.S. and China both think it is the other superpower's doing, and launches the cataclysmic attack. The U.S. is destroyed. China and Russia suffer massive blows, destroying the majority of their populace. As per the treaty, the Chinese do not send warheads to the West. Vaul-Tec remains in the safety of the Europe, free from destruction and with it's influence on every remaining government body. Life continues in the Old World continents, and eventually the Vault-Tec experiments serve their purposes, leading to safer facilities and self-sufficient societies to take hold in Europe. These would go on to expand into China and Russia, utilizing the GECKs to terraform the landscape back to a habitable one. Society continues in both the Old World and the New World, in more ways than one.

TL;DR: Vault-Tec begins as a good guy trying to find a way to survive a nuclear holocaust, gets tripped up by the issues of capitalism and imperialism, and eventually sets up a base in Europe. Base in Europe leads to contacts to China and some big brain moves that lead to Vault-Tec starting the Great War. Over time, Vault-Tec utilizes the data they have gotten from the American vaults to resettle the Old World continents with sustainable society with fail safes against further nuclear holocausts.",My Great War/Vault-Tec Theory

1533,Fallout,"Right, so this is a wild speculation based only on the inclusion of a particular song on the FO76 soundtrack, but I want to throw it out there in the bonkers case that I'm actually right.

Now, then, Fallout under Bethesda has always had thematic music choices. The very first song I heard on FO3's radio after leaving Vault 101 was Way Back Home, an obvious choice given the game's theme of ""you can't go home again."" New Vegas had Ain't That A Kick In the Head which obviously referenced the fact that the Courier had been shot in the head. Fallout 4 had Personality, which until recently I hadn't associated with the fact that the game dealt with artificial intelligence, featuring robots that had *personalities* of their own.

FO76 has Mister Sandman on the radio. Sure, there's the perk of the same name and that might be why the song's in there, but suppose it's hinting at something. Suppose the repetition of ""bring me a dream"" is hinting that the events of FO76 are in fact a virtual reality ""dream"" that the protagonist of Fallout 5 will wake up from at the beginning. Maybe it'll be Appalachia in the future somewhere around FO4's time or maybe it'll be something else experiencing a problem that it needed FO76's story to be instructive about, but consider it. The game flashes back to a bunch of vault dwellers fighting the scorchbeast queen with ""Mister Sandman"" playing over the fight. The scene is timed so that the song starts to fade as the closing ""Mister Sandman"" plays under a man talking and ""bring me a dream"" plays as your pod opens.

Am I being my own proctologist with this wild speculation? Admittedly, very much so, but I've had dumber ideas that had way less possibility than this does. Do I think it's likely? Hell, no. Do I think it's *possible*? Yes.

1557,Fallout,"So I recently finished Prey(2017) by Arkane Studios and I noticed that a lot of the things I liked about it were things I liked in Dead Money.

TLDR: Dead Money is trying to be an immersive sim because it makes the player pay attention to the game world in order for them to succeed and understand the context of the story.

To make my Mildly Warm Take/Late Realisation more thoroughly:

Success in both games requires paying close attention to the world and the way that things react in semi-believable ways rather than relying completely on player skill/stats. Some examples from Dead Money would be making the connection that old fountains=chips, using the audio logs to swap between God/Dog, paying attention to the various trap locations (Trip wires in doorways, bear traps in the Cloud, hologram/speaker locations). The one that I feel is unique to Dead Money is taking the gold bars, which is managed completely by the player and how they get around Father Elijah and the Vault trap. It's kind of why I wouldn't even concider the methods that let you steal all the gold bars an exploit as it's players using the way that Elijah reacts against him. This is in opposition to, for example, the infinite gun glitch at Camp Guardian were you just bounce between 2 repeating dialogue options.

In regards to Prey specifically, I think Dead Money shares some similar ideas. Enemies that are best dealt with using unconventional methods, crafting systems reliant on returning junk items to be broken down, backstory told via note, recordings, and world details like corpse placement.

I'm not saying all these ideas land perfectly, I completely understand why Dead Money is so divisive, but for me personally it was a moment of clarity. I finally understood what made me love Dead Money's gameplay.",I've realised Dead Money was an Immersive Sim after playing Prey

&amp;#x200B;

If it's hard to imagine that, imagine what your character would be based  in F4 story.

As an example of my character:

His name Adrian. Adrian Volkov. Bored philistine, a weasel, with morbid curiosity.

In pre-war life, he was a nobody. Or so it seemed. But after bombs fell, was a chance opened up that not everyone gets. Adrian became a ghoul. This opened up many opportunities for satisfying his irrepressible curiosity. As he drifted around the world... until got the Commonwealth, Adrian became embroiled in intrigues wished he could stay away from. Working with local resistance, Adrian worked his way higher and higher, toward mystery that surrounded the Commonwealth world and the Institute. To a secret, that would allow to get a nice prize, and get rid of imposed obligations. Along way, Adrian met a lot different people, pretended to be friends with them, but did not let anyone get close to him. 

He go a bodyguard, a member of the Brotherhood of steel, who has one big secret. Brotherhood rejected him, and Adrian took him in. This gear is a loyal like dog, that Adrian uses as a bodyguard, and to warm his bed. These are hard times, and danger is getting closer. But Adrian can handle it. In any case, running away is also an option. Main thing, is to have time to mix cards so that all pieces fall into a pile, and destroy each other.

I write this, first because I have seen many topics on this subreddit about this issue and mostly partial answers or slightly incomplete tutorials (which helped me lots in building this), but I think there is the need of a full tutorial. Second, because I have no friends who play RL and I'm a Switch player so I had noone to ask how it's done and I've seen ***no complete tutorial*** of how to make it work. There are multiple steps and there is no place where you can find the whole process, but only pieces of it. Third and final, because there've been events like RLCS and Goals for Change these days, that have activated rewards, and many people in the chat have doubts.

I hope this is helpful.

# Procedure

Steps:

1. Connecting Nintendo account to Rocket League account in-game
2. Connecting Nintendo account to Epic Games account
3. Connecting to Twitch and getting rewards
4. Redeeming drops
5. Troubleshooting

&amp;#x200B;

\- **First step:** Connecting Nintendo account to Rocket League account in-game

This first step is the most overseen and causes trouble later. It is pretty simple, though, just go to the Main Menu in the game and then go to *Settings* and then to the *Extras* tab.

You'll see an option that says ""Link to Nintendo Account"" as can be seen in the following image:

&amp;#x200B;

[Vincular Cuenta de Nintendo = Link Nintendo account](https://preview.redd.it/5yhrptglraq61.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4140e3d8a522b878f75decbeeb51a71834fe7af)

Click it. You can get either a success message, or an Error message that says that your account was already linked. In that case, you shouldn't worry.

\- **Second step:** Connecting Nintendo account to Epic Games account

To do this you have to head to [https://www.rocketleague.com/activate](https://www.rocketleague.com/activate) and log into your Epic Games account and Nintendo Switch account (and any other you want to link). The site will then ask you to choose a primary account. Choose the Nintendo Switch one (Unless it isn't your primary, in which case you probably shouldn't need this guide lol).

[Connect your Epic Account and your Nintendo Switch one. Then, choose the latter as the primary account.](https://preview.redd.it/armqykkfeaq61.jpg?width=1346&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42d313a9880c20605b3e60ddc529fc15d9cbecf8)

That should be all for this step, but you can also link the accounts here, just in case.

[Scroll down until you see the Nintendo Switch option and then Connect it.](https://preview.redd.it/755k6b3ueaq61.jpg?width=1353&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fc085d2aef985fbd90c57d23f31b9e5b2bf36b3)

\- **Third step:** Connecting to Twitch and getting rewards

Go now to [https://rewards.rocketleague.com](https://rewards.rocketleague.com) and log into your twitch account. After you've done it, click the Nintendo Switch logo and log into your Nintendo Switch account. After that, you should be ready to get drops.

https://preview.redd.it/lii344dxeaq61.jpg?width=1225&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d31c7061b0a7d94f484ab5d2e694a8aa0f95ad7

To get drops, you have to watch a Rocket League stream with these activated. You can recognize them by the flair under the stream:

&amp;#x200B;

[Drops activados = Activated Drops \(indication of rewards activated\)](https://preview.redd.it/xr5srjetpaq61.jpg?width=1026&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc964ced87b930d61b3ceb34d10bb95bee61fd6f)

Just watch the stream and a progression bar will appear when you click your profile icon on the top-right corner.

You should see something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ij6hi7l7qaq61...*

\- **Fourth step:** Redeeming drops

When the bar reaches 100%, you can click it and it'll take you to the inventory page. Here you can redeem your drops.

[The ones full coloured are the ones you already redeemed, the ones with a progression bar are the ones in progress \(of course\) and the ones with a lock are the ones that are not yet available until you get the previous one.](https://preview.redd.it/4balw5g8qaq61.jpg?width=1266&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289ce78e4aad597368b50aa2d80a2dd7d28cc36c)

As you can see, different streams have a different set of rewards. In this case you can get 3 drops from each channel (or set of channels) and you have to watch 4 hours to get each drop. These numbers can change.

Next time you play Rocket League you should see something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p1arcbfkraq61.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ea29a7fe99729d5cfdfe8148857306f2b4dd197

\- **Fifth step:** Troubleshooting

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I get an error message in the third step, that says that the accounts couldn't be connected.

That happens when you don't do the first step. It happened to me and it happens to most people, because it is a pretty weird step that noone mentions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I have more than one user in the same console, and we even share the Nintendo eShop. How do I link my second user and not the default one?

Each user is associated to a different e-mail account. To find out which e-mail that is, go to the top-left corner and click your icon. You'll see the e-mail associated here:

[You can identify the right e-mail although it is censored.](https://preview.redd.it/o5ssvztxraq61.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79755b7fb8b264a9f310866c4faee6bf9ea05d4d)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I am watching the stream but there is no progress bar, what's the issue?

It could be that the accounts are not connected as they should (You can check that in the Connections section on Twitch's page), or maybe you collected all the drops available per stream.

Make sure the stream is not paused or you won't get any progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone been through the same? Please forgive if this looks like a dumb question, I play RL since 2017 but never bought a premium pass before so I wanted to read some opinions on that matter

64,RocketLeague," Hello,

Since Epic acquired Rocket League, when we launch the game, there is a sequence where the player is forced to do a serie of 5 inputs in a ""scripted"" training game.

There is no option given to the player whatsoever to skip this introduction sequence, nor is there an option to change your control settings.

This is a CRITICAL issue for quadraplegic players using [https://www.quadstick.com/](https://www.quadstick.com/) or other similar controllers that require access to a setting menu before playing; they need to have the option to adjust their settings before being forced into the game. Right now, the game doesn't provide this option, for no reason other then to create immersion on game launch.

I am looking to get this issue resolved ASAP, and have already sent an email to Tim, CEO of Epic Games. Developpers should strive to make gaming accessible to as many people as possible, and this arbitrary limitation prevents any players that have special, adapted controllers from even getting to the settings menu, only to have a ""cool"" looking game start experience.

A very quick fix could be implemented in a few days of work at most of adding an option to skip this introduction sequence. This would make your game available to people with accessibility needs again.

We need a fast response regarding this issue, as it is blocking quadreplegic players from accessing your game, and this is unacceptable. There is nothing more hurtful to someone living with a disability then to open a new game to play with friends only to be blocked from even trying the game. My close friend never feels handicaped in her daily life, but these kind of things where accessibility is blatantly ignored for no reason are the ones that remind her of her condition, and it's extremely hurtful.

I would love to have community support on this issue as well. The resolution is very easy to implement, for an issue that is preventing every gamers from enjoying the games they want to love.",Critical issue: Rocket league is non-accessible to quadraplegic players since the introduction of the forced introduction sequence.

81,RocketLeague,"Ok, let me explain. I’m a new player to the game (just installed it two weeks ago), and I’m starting to learn the lingo of the game. Last night I was playing 3v3 with randoms, and the other team won’t stop spamming “60” in the game chat. I stayed playing against them for a couple more matches and they kept with that thing. For what I can recall, whenever they scored a goal they would go and write “60” on the chat. Whenever we scored a goal to them, they would write “260”. And whenever they exploded anyone of use, they would literally stop playing just to write either “60” or “pog60” in the chat.
I asked a friend who has a lot more experience than me if he knew what the meaning of “60” was and if it even was a lingo in RL. My friend said he had never listened to it before, but he also said he was not an expert and that it may well be an underground reference to a stream or something.",Is “60” and “260” a part of RL terminology?

I have picked up Rocket League at a friends request about 5 or 6 months ago. I really enjoy playing this game and collecting various items for my vehicles and collecting the vehicles themselves. One thing, however, is that I simply cannot seem to be able to play tournaments. No, I do not believe this is any fault of my own.   


Everytime I play a tournament 1 of 3 things happen:  
1. A player sits there the entire game because they are afk  
2. A player will lose connection and leave the game  
3. A player will leave the game because who knows why  


In the screenshot provided, the case was that my teammate LITERALLY HAD 999 PING. I haven't even seen that before. It's probably not their fault, but also maybe it is. I don't know. Needless to say it affected the game more than I would have liked. I don't think this is something that Psyonix can even fix, but it just is so frustrating. Does anybody else have this experience?

159,RocketLeague,"Right now, you have to precisely use your controller to manually move the cameras.  This makes it difficult and time consuming for most of us to make great videos.  That's really time consuming.

One important factor in the game's success is its Content Creators.  There's nothing like a new SunlessKhan video with great edits to get us amped up.  A revamped Replay Viewer that makes it easier to make Replays would create a marked improvement in that, and help more people create quality shots.  It might also help creators like Sunless get more videos because it's easier to get the shot right the first time and have time for more content.  

**The method:**

Many other games, like EA's series (I know NHL11, 13, etc had it), feature the ability to create keyframes where you set the camera's rotation and speed, and it smoothly transitions and rotations between the two keyframes.  It also allowed you to adjust the speed at a keyframe, in case the shot deserved a slowdown or something.  Once you have it like you want, you could have the game render a video.

Something like this would really make Rocket League better.  If we could also have settings like ""Render at full settings and higher resolution"", so we don't have to stress our GPUs with real time rendering while capturing video (possibly generating lag/bad shots).

This is honestly an easy fix as the only reason you currently cant is because the cancel queue button is the same as the search.

(NOT SURE IF IT IS LIKE THIS ON PS4 or SWITCH.)

2.   Being able to trade in 5 **(Or however many)** mystery decal tournament rewards of one(**Say hades bomb)** to get the other one**(Like Nergal)**.  Honestly, luck is crazy good for some and crazy bad for some others. When epic came in they wanted to get rid of the aspect of gambling because of many reasons including laws. But now people are gambling something more valuable than money, they are gambling their time. The outcome doesn't even have to be a painted version in fact I think it would be broken if you can get a painted one but whatever. As for the problem of switching back and forth, you can just put a property on it saying it can't be switched back over or something  

&amp;#x200B;

3 Copying presets. If I ever want to have 2 identical presets with different wheels or for whatever reason this would be a great feature and I think the china version has it but not 100 percent sure on that. 

4. Making it possible to invite through parties on Xbox. Im not exactly sure what the reason is behind the removal of this feature but it definitely is a lot harder now to trade and invite friends.

**5. Being able to search or filter out certain colours would be amazing. Alternatively, you can make collections and just do that. I think an easier fix would be to filter out everything BUT archived items so you can just click that on and archive the stuff you love(Other than favourites)**",Some Quality Of Life Suggestions I came up with In Order Of Difficulty.

So, I decided to try a ps5 controller about 20 days ago. I have been gaming on Xbox One Controllers. The I find the looks of the PS5 controller sexy af. The controller would just keep losing its connection. I liked the feel of the feel of the controller, feels more natural and its material does not make my hand sweat as much as the XBO controller, so did not mind playing wired. 

My L2 had issues from beginning but it worked, I mean its just reverse right. Like I did not need it as much but I could tell there was something wrong. Today, I went to exchange it. I have spent the last 2 hours troubleshooting with no luck. 

I remember I had an old bluetooth adapter from like 2011. I took me 2 minutes to find it. Surprisingly, I found the driver online still. 

Installed the driver, disabled the built-in bluetooth. Restarted PC and when it came back started the pairing process. 

Immediately notices that the adapter recognized the controller as a Game controller and not an HID-component. I smiled 😀, looked at the controller and it picked settings from my wired config. Open up steam and control shows up there, launched my favorite game and it works!


So, if you are having issues with built ins. I would suggest getting a separate adapter. Idk what would cause this issue. 

The adapter I have, I know it has at least Bluetooth 2.0, the built in on the mobo should be 5.0 I believe.

What is your experience with PS5 controller and Bluetooth connections? 

What are you using a built-in or adapter? 

What version of Bluetooth dies your solution use?",PS5 controller did not work with built-in bluetooth on BF-550-I mobo.

Does this means all these people that quit right after the game can't play ranked for 5 minutes?

So essentially sometimes I can land on my roof when I do a backwards flip, like 1 out of 5 times, but as I said when it comes to forward flips I can’t even get it to land on it’s roof or sometimes work.

579,RocketLeague,"Yes, I fully understand that the F1 DLC is far from ready and obtainable, but I'm sensing a perfect opportunity for Psyonix to inject one of my favorite sport's theme songs into the game, written by Bryan Tyler.

[This is the full track in case you are unfamiliar with the song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTETwgQnbsQ) It kind of has that SARPBC Anthem vibes to it, so I had an idea that if F1 gave them the licensing to do the car, they might a well package the Theme song in the deal! 

As for how they could chop up the song so it's ideal for a anthem, I'm thinking the high-energy sections, either the part about 20 seconds into the clip, or the Fanfare near the 2min 30sec mark. I am fully aware that many here don't like the idea of more Anthems, but they are most likely here to stay, and I personally would love to cruise through this game with this theme as my preset Anthem. Of course, I could also just do with the song being added to the in game radio, but let me know your thoughts below.

I would include NASCAR theme as another option, but I don't follow NASCAR, so I have no idea if they even have an anthem =P

643,RocketLeague,"Today, Richard Lewis joined the G2 broadcast to cast their games over the spring split. This has caught the criticism of many Twitter users who want to cancel him and want him out of these scene. The purpose of this post is to hi-light just some of the work he has done throughout his career and force you to consider if it is really worth “cancelling” him over Twitter arguments. 

Throughout his career as an esports journalist Richard Lewis has been involved with games like CSGO, Overwatch, and League of Legends. His work has done nothing but try to better every one of those scenes. He has exposed countless people, organizations, and companies who have tried (and succeeded) at taking advantage of players, fans, and the sport itself. His actions have always reflected his integrity, and his integrity defines him as a person. He is never afraid to speak his mind no matter who he is talking to or the power they have. To show this I want to share just some of the work he’s done over his tenure as an Esports Journalist. 

[In 2015 he exposed match fixing at the highest level of the Counter-Strike professional scene.](https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/match-fixing-counter-strike-ibuypower-netcode-guides-1256) Despite the players blatantly lying, and leveraging their fans against him, he proved these allegations with proof through his investigation and resources alone. [More recently he has called out a number of coaches for using a spectator bug to cheat over four years of competition](https://youtu.be/u1DvEO2KaK0) These are just two instances but there are many more examples of him calling out cheaters. Now consider the damage this does to an esports scene. How can fans and viewers enjoy a match when in the back of their head they know it is legitimately scripted? When someone cheats or throws a match, it literally costs players their future or fans their money. It is extremely detrimental to the scene as a whole. 

[In 2016 he exposed ProSyndicate and Tmartn for advertising their own gambling website, where they controlled the odds and could manipulate them in their favor in order to make their website more appealing to their fans.](https://dotesports.com/general/news/richard-lewis-discusses-tmartns-latest-venture-a-pyramid-scheme-10960) Aside from taking gross advantage of their fans, this was a violation of FTC guidelines and the literal FTC settled a case against them and reviewed their guidelines for online gambling. Who does this protect? A young, impressionable audience who frequent those websites. 

[In 2018 and since he was one of the very few journalists who published articles and call out Riot Games for their company culture, in which sexual harassment was a common occurrence for female employees.](https://www.vpesports.com/more-esports/part-1-see-no-evil-hear-no-evil-speak-no-evil-the-gaming-medias-wise-monkeys-and-riot-games) Thats right. The makers of Valorant has had to settle dozens of sexual harassment cases, and many victims have spoken out against the company for promoting this behavior through their company culture. 

[In 2020 he called out a popular Brazilian team for multiple homophobic comments, taking advantage of their fans, and cheating.](https://youtu.be/jhi3A-jM2pM)

He has repeatedly called out tournament organizers for not paying their players or employees, when those people are in a position to get blacklisted if they speak out. He’s also helped prevent many new players from being taken advantage by helping reviewing their contracts and offering proper resources. He’s not afraid to call out teams or players either when they are taking advantage of their fans. This is what he does. 

So now with all that in mind, consider this: will having him in Rocket League esports benefit or hinder the scene? Everything that he has done so far has been to keep the esports scene heathy, and away from bad faith actors. His biggest critics are fans of the teams or companies he’s criticized, which is extremely ironic when they’re usually the ones being taken advantage of. The biggest criticisms of him are that he blocks people on Twitter and uses hyperboles. Is THAT it? That is what should stop him from being involved with the Rocket League scene? Doesn’t that seem ridiculous?

Look at his track record and think about how he will benefit the future of Rocket League esports and stop it from becoming a cesspool for corruption.",Richard Lewis absolutely belongs in Esports and we would be so lucky to have him be a part of Rocket League’s future.

I have a bit of an issue with xbox controllers and I am a bit tired of replacing mine every 3-6 months. I am a bit hard on my controllers and that's part of the issue, but Im wondering if any of you know a durable alternative as a controller.

For the most part, the problems with my controller start with stick drift issue from either right or left joystick, depending on the game I play, but mostly Rocket League. I have own multiples Xbox controller over the years, but since I play Rocket League; a Xbox Elite (series 1) which didn't last at all, probably 3-4 months top, and 2 Power A Spectra, including one I recently changed back in October 2020. The last one I got is still in pretty good shape except for my left joystick which automaticly goes up for no reason, thanks to Modern Warfare's tactical sprint... Nevertheless, whenever I try to aerial with this controller I immediatly fall, as my defect joystick makes the front of my car dips down or flip cancel when I backflip. So I now play with a less crucial defected controller that makes my air roll mostly inconsistent...

At this point, I pretty tired of replacing my controller that often and Im looking for a better solution. I am aware that the pressure I put on my controller is probably too high and im looking forwards to change my method, although I still want to put every chances on my side by purchasing a more durable controller. However, my research were a bit difficult, especially since players don't experiment the same issues. For my part, it is mainly about stick drift issues from joystick. 

Therefore, I am looking for a compatible PC controller, that gives me the ability to have at least two more customizable buttons, with, of course, a durable build. I prefer the Xbox controller layout, but I am not close to using a Playstation one. 

I don't know if a Scuf controller would be worth or if the Xbox Elite controller is really a durable controller with whom I just had a bad luck.

Any recommandation of controllers help me a ton ! Plus any strategies to reduce stress on controllers or even reduce the in-game influence of a deffect controller would be greatly appreciated !

Thanks a lot in advance !

665,RocketLeague,I swear some days I win a lot and move up very fast. Other days I lose every game. The opposing team is super toxic and seem way higher in skill than my rank. While my teammates are always off getting boost when I make a beautiful center and rotate. It must be that at certain times of day there are a bunch smurf teams. I also had 2 opponents purposefully throwing the game. There has got to be something going on. Maybe its the time of day and a bunch of kids are playing and half are terrible and half are toxic smurfs. Why do I keep getting the terrible ones. It's just that every game today my team was just constantly dunked on. How is there always artificially low ranked players playing against me and my team of randoms who don't even know how to play on a team but are platinum somehow. Don't bother telling me that I suck and just need to get better. I have played a lot of games where my team of randoms dominated another team of randoms. I am just saying its crazy to lose 10 games in a row to players well organized who know what they are doing and hitting aerials and rotating like pros.,There has got to be something going on here.

678,RocketLeague,"My computer is relatively new still, my GPU drivers are up to date and this only seems to happen in Rocket League.

I only really notice it in free play (likely because there's not much to look at) and it presents itself as these arbitrary little flickers of light/artifacts that are not too noticeable and only 'flicker'; there is no imprinted image of discolored or affected pixels. 

I at first really thought this had to do with screen tearing. I play on a 60 hz monitor without vsync, so naturally I thought it was that. I played with vsync on and the problem still persists (for whatever reason the games tearing/jitters don't seem to be helped with vsync in this game anyway). 

To note, these slight flickers are most noticeable on Mannfield - but can happen on any. Its just the most apparent there for whatever reason.

My video settings are pretty standard: All off except transparent goalposts, performance. I messed with the FPS cap as well, doesn't seem to fix it.

Anyone else experience this? I'm afraid of having a defective system somehow... it is playable and not very noticeable especially in game. But where the background is completely open in free play -- that is where I notice it (especially with movement of my car, which is initially why I linked it to tears).

679,RocketLeague,"Hey guys,

Brand new to the game! Me and my friends started playing RL about a month ago and we are all in gold division and are out here sweatin to win our first tournament. Except the last 3-4 tournaments we have played we have played smurfs every single time. I’m talking platinum and diamond tournament winners in our gold division bracket.

Can somebody explain the logic behind this? Do people just get absolutely bodied in their own tournaments so hard that they have to lower their rank to ruin the fun of people in lower ranks? Do they get certain rewards? 

I’ve also ran into tons of diamond/plat tournament winners in ranked who will go up on us 5-1 and then just forfeit the game with a few seconds left.

Is this something that is fairly common?",I’m new here - but why are there so many smurfs in tournaments?

808,RocketLeague,,A first time for everything. Never able to do this in training but here we are...
809,RocketLeague,,♥️♥️♥️ let's go.
810,RocketLeague,Happens a bit often but once it does it will not stop and I have to force restart the game. It says joining and then loads a black screen with loading in the corner and boots me to main menu saying I timed out. Once that happens it will repeat itself with any other match and I have to restart my game.,Cannot connect to match error loop.
811,RocketLeague,"**Note -** These are suggestions that I think the community would like either **fixed or added.** Note this is all on **\[Epic Games\]** and might be for other platforms if they are needed or are an issue on other platforms as well. Please consider these.

**Obvious:**

1. **Ranking System / teaming** (This one people love debating so don't get mad if you disagree) - If we lose a rank when getting harder people the team can make a way for it to be a little harder to lose the ranks? I've noticed it's easy to lose your ranks if you get unlucky with people that are better with the same rank. A more complex ranking system? Match you with people more your skill level? Rather then rank level. *That would make it more fair in my own opinion.*
2. **Ai \[Bots\]** \- There's tons of mods out there making the bots have more capabilities. If they were more complex they would help players build skill. Maybe team up with one of the teams working on complex Ai for rocket League? That would help a lot of people. I think it would help the players that have to be offline also. Have a more variety of hard / easy bots.
3. **Better map / mod support** \- I have installed mods before, it does take a bit of effort to install mods. If the team could try and find a way to add better mod support for the current mods and future mods? It would be greatly appreciated.

**Smaller-**

1. **The profile picture for Rocket League \[Epic Games\]** \- There's no way to have a profile picture on Epic games besides using mods. It kind-of takes away from the immersive part. Since now it's just a empty spot. It would be awesome to have this simple feature. I have no clue in designing games so I'm not sure how hard of a fix this would be but I wouldn't think it would be too hard.
2. **The built in vc** \- I noticed that this was usable when the steam version was still around. But in the Epic Games version it's still there even though there's no way to use it from what I've seen. I'm suggesting either remove it or make it useable again. 

Please take these in consideration with the Team. I would love if these features could either be fixed or added. If the team adds these I bet everyone would be super appreciative! I hope people agree. We need these fixes. 

Thank you.

I've been pulling my hair out since May of 2020 when AMD updated their drivers and killed Rocket League in DX11. Ever since then I've been putting up with 25-55fps in game no matter what resolution or setting I choose. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/t5Igc8O) is a pic at 2560x1440 in the menu with everything turned on.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/4tnX1KM) is a pic at 640x480 with everything turned off.

As you can see, the fps doesn't even change in the menu. If I force DX9 I can get 250+fps in game easily, but I have to deal with some crashing and textures missing as they no longer officially support it.

If anyone has any idea what I could do to fix it that would be amazing. Google searches tend to lead me to issues that aren't related to mine and finding anything DX11 specific is a nightmare.","Really Bad FPS with 5700XT, no setting has any effect."

939,RocketLeague,"So, I'm quite new to this game (played a bit several years ago, maybe a couple of hours in total, but only took it up again 2,5 months ago).  

I'm in Gold 3 (div 4) in 2v2 and on a brink of enetering Platinum. But, lo and behold, **every** f***ing time me and my teammate get to the match we have to win to rank up, we end up playing with two unranked players who are **obviously** smurfs. Random names, plain cars, no decals, boosts, nothing. And they kick our asses with several goals in difference.

Also, when playing 3v3 and we're on a brink of a rank up to Plat, there is always one guy on our team that is unranked and should be a bronze (like ""I only installed this game a day ago"" bronze).

Does this happen to others? If yes, WTF? Why?

I’ve watched a tonne of YT on how to improve and learning new stuff like half flip has really helped even if it is basic.

941,RocketLeague,,The first time I hit a shot and I was actually surprised with myself.
942,RocketLeague,"Hi. I have a question and i could use some help. Before the F2P update i have played RL both on PS4 and PC. MY PC was not very good back then, so when it broke and i needed to fix it, i played on PS4. I like trading a lot, so i did that on both platforms. This resulted in a nice amount of (now) credits. To be very clear, i earned all credits on seperate platforms. And that is where my problem begins. Because of the shared inventory, i can use all the items i have on both platforms. But the credits are just very weird. I am maining PC, so I thought i'd buy an item from my leftover credits on PS4, so i could use it on pc. So I did, and logged on to my PC and noticed that i lost the amount of credits I spent on my PS4. And i just dont get it. The amount of credits is different on both platforms.  Credits dont add on the other platform, they only ""disappear"".

950,RocketLeague,"This player (my team mate) left the game with around a minute and a half to go as we were 4 goals down, just as the game timer was on 1 to 2 seconds left, his name popped up as re-joining and completely avoided the punishment they would've otherwise gotten from leaving half-way through the game, I know they avoided the cooldown punishment as I played with them again the very next game - which I started the queue for as soon as the game ended. This type of behaviour only justifies their toxicity as they are purposely ruining other players experiences while also avoiding the systems method of trying to combat toxicity.

As said in the title, it undermines a system to prevent toxicity, toxic players are bad enough as is but when they find ways to cheat the system it incentivises them to continue being like this as they know they aren't punished.

You first need to play casual, level up and then purposefully lose your placement matches in order to be able to play a Bronze tournament.

My username had 5 letters of my 7 lettered name, and my friends told me the other team mentioned it in the chat with only 1 letter wrong (but it might be a typo on their end because the letters are beside each other). My friends also said they said something else but they didn't able to see it because the a lot of them were chatting (For some reason, I don't see what the opponent's are saying on my end). I don't know if my friends are right or wrong or their just joking around but they told me I got ""doxxed"". I searched the term and I found out that it's pretty bad. I play on Switch so I don't know how much they could find out about me. 

So I have a few questions, what info can they get from me with doxxing and what do people usually do with the info? Can they really attain a lot of stuff from my Switch? Did someone ""doxx"" me or was it just a coincidence? Is it possible to see chat from past games to see what he said? And if my console was hacked or ""doxxed"" can they hack my other devices and be more overall exposed?

  However, it feels so off, everything about it.  Like your car goes in almost a circle around the ball, but I can never tell where my car is actually going to go when I push a direction.

\-Generally what is the prize for winning?

\-If the prize is credits, how do you go about distributing them on someone who is not on pc? I know you can trade credits to people on pc no problem.

\-How do you deal with smurfs? That's gotten a little wild since F2P happened

\-Do you do a free for all, or do you split folks up into ranks? And if so, how would you deal with lets say a group of diamonds vs GC's at the end?

1275,RocketLeague,"Like many other rocketeers I would love to hit some of the clips I see from higher ranks/youtubers. I picked up the game when it went F2P in September and got hooked. I've watched plenty of tutorials on aerial car control, but always wanted to know how long it takes to get to different mechanical ""checkpoints"" to give me more motivation to practice, so I figured I would document this for myself and others to look back and see where I came from.

My general philosophy - try to use uncomfortable mechanics in game, you will screw up but learn much faster than being totally safe. I also prefer training packs to get an idea of how to execute a shot before trying to set them up myself in freeplay.

\----------------------------

As of today (3/28) here are my stats:

275 hours, Diamond 1

\----------------------------

**Here are the mechanics I know and how I got there:**

**Half Flip**: watched a youtube video and practiced for 5 mins in training, then use as much as possible in game. Easy to see results in rotations and saves.

**Speed Flip**: watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfCecDIaJE4) youtube video which I found to be much easier than other tutorials. Practice for 20 mins in training then use a lot in game. BEWARE you WILL \*\*\*\* this up in game often so your teammates will rage. I find speed flips more useful for getting around/recoveries than for kickoffs.

**Air Dribble**: I can push the ball in the air if I get the setup right (\~50% of the time), still not good at holding the ball up. This will become easier I'm guessing once I can twist in the air. I've spent \~5 hours in training total practicing these shots.

**Fast Aerial**: I am confident in my fast aerial shots which helped me get to diamond. This takes some aerial training practice (couple hours) after watching Kevpert's tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAO1sqr135c). After feeling confident in just getting a quicker touch on the ball you should be able to beat most plats to the ball and keep pressure up, even with mostly inaccurate touches.

**Dribbles/Flicks**:

This is my favorite to practice because I can set them up really quick in freeplay. Flicks have been key to me ranking up since I can now set them up quick enough to not get dunked. I first learned to dribble by using bakkes mod to get the ball on top of my car (up on d pad) and using the wall to hold the ball up. Once I'm comfortable I practice keeping the ball up and driving around. Spent probably 5 hours total practicing between matches or just 10 mins here and there. If you want a break from training, 1s is great to practice ground play.

\----------------------------

**What I'm working on:**

**Aerial Car Control**:

Kuxir Twist/Air roll during aerials: This makes little sense to my brain so I can't really use it in game and just flail around in freeplay. So I'm practicing each aerial direction at a time doing pro aerial training. First I run through all 10 shots upside down. Then I replay alternating normal fast aerial/upside down. I've reran these 10 shots probably 10 times now and can see definite improvement. Up next will be doing this on each side which I'm confident will help me revisit learning the Kuxir twist.

**Ceiling Shots**:

I spent about an hour using training packs and am super inconsistent. Don't have enough of a feel to try in game, but opponents who can hit these fairly consistently usually beat me in diamond ranks. I feel like I should revisit this after I have better aerial control.

**Ground to air dribble**:

I can sometimes get these right, but can very rarely set them up right in game. Only scored 1 or 2 in match ever. Big skill gap between training packs dropping a perfect setup and the bounces you see in game. Lower ranks have weaker hits (resulting in small bounces) too so it's hard to try in match.

**Rotations**:

I'm good at rotating back post and speedflips have helped with my recoveries. Sometimes I feel like my rotations take me out of the play and I have a hard time balancing rotating/getting boost/staying relevant. I'll keep feeling this one out.

1285,RocketLeague,"Hey all, 

Recently this weird issue I've been having lately has been happening much more frequently. I play a good amount of games, typically around 5-10, and then suddenly my controls feel very unresponsive when handling the car.

Once it happens I've yet to figure out a way to fix it. I always just quit playing and next time I play the game a day or hours later it seems to be fine again for about the same amount of time. 

I can almost positively say it's not actual controller input lag. I watch my controllers ping with DS4Windows and it's constantly at 1-2ms. Plus it doesn't actually feel like input lag because the wheels turn exactly when I want them to, it's more like the controls are just limited. More specifically, the wheels respond to my controller inputs as fast as I perform them, but the car just finishes the input slower/or doesn't respond completely to the input? 

Ultimately this results in me having a MUCH wider turn radius than I should normally have and general car control is sluggish feeling. Other symptoms is the game sometimes feels like it's running at 90% gamespeed for a brief second, which further implies to me that it's not a controller issue, and actually a game issue.

It's worth noting this has happened to me before I switched to PS5 controller as well. I had 2 Xbox One controllers and the same thing would happen as well.

Would immensely appreciate if someone has gone through this before and knows of a fix.","Help troubleshooting some random ""input lag"" (PC - Steam) (PS5 Controller)"

However over the last few days as I've been finishing up the challenges I needed to do to get the drops I noticed that I only had 20 out of 22 and now I have 21 out of 22, but if I am correct there are 6 free challenges per stage and I have completed all but 2 of those challenges. So I think unless my math and logic is just completely wrong then rocket league bugged and screwed me over for my challenges. This wouldnt be a problem if I was actually good at the game and i could grind out the last two challenges but its frustrated me to the point I dont want to give my time to something that could possibly bug again and not give me any drops at all and the only two challenges I have left is getting 100 saves and one isnt even half way done while the other is 86/100 but I dont feel that I should need to have to grind that.

1460,RocketLeague,"My 10 year old just won his first silver tournament, and it was one hell of a rush for me as a spectator!

Right now he's still trying to return to earth again while the last dregs of adrenaline is leaving his system.


But first a bit of backstory...

He was an avid Fortnite player, mainly because that's what all his classmates were and are playing, but he has steadily grown tired of the game itself and the negative energy the game somehow manages to stir in him and his friends.
Half a year or so ago we downloaded Rocket League and played it for a bit together. It didn't really do much for me, though, so we just played it sporadically in order to play something together.

During the last months he's been playing it more and more by himself, which has sadly resulted in him frequently begin bullied by a group of kids from his class, who apparently will do their utmost to trash the game and everyone who plays it, because... well, it isn't Fortnite. My kid tries to ignore it, which is tough, and his general mood has definitely suffered from it. We're in touch with his teachers, and hopefully it will be resolved sooner rather than later. 

Anyhow, I have followed his progress from the sidelines, and while I don't really know much about the game, it's obvious that he's getting better and better. Lately he has started to enroll in tournaments and has managed to get to second and third round a couple of times, which he was pretty stoked about.

Today he registered again, and he asked me to watch his first game. They had a very equal first game which went down the wire, and it was obvious that his two teammates were pretty damn awesome. Aside from playing well, they were super nice and friendly cheering everyone on and giving encouragement even after going behind. They edged the match in OT and went on to battle their way into the semis. Here they lost the first of three and were down by two in the second with just 60 sec on the clock. The kid was pretty downbeat by now as one of the goals was his fault, as he had botched what should have been an easy save. His two teammates continued to encourage him in chat, though, and they scored two in quick succession to level the score with a few seconds to go. They rode the wave of positivity to tie the series 1-1 and eventually win the decider! My kid was a shambles of nerves, but in the short interlude before the final, we talked about how cool it was to actually reach a final for the first time and what a great overall experience it had been with these teammates.

They lost their first finals match, played a super tight second which was won in OT and then went on to sweep the last match 4-1. My kid was needless to say nothing short of extatic and he spent much of the second part of the last match where they were up by 3 talking about how much he would have to thank his teammates if they would eventually win.

When all was said and done the chat was a flurry of GGs and 'That was fun!' - including from all three of his opponents, which was amazing to see! I have played MANY competitive online games, where chat instead would have been chock-full of gloating and negativity after a final like this, so I was super surprised and glad to see such positivity.


Anyhow, pardon my ramble, but I just wanted to voice my appreciation for a handful of players who hopefully are somewhat representative of your community as a whole.

My kid had a brilliant time and will no doubt keep gunning for higher ranks and perhaps eventually higher tiers of tournaments as well!",A wholesome experience
