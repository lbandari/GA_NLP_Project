Someone posted \"there are mechanics I love and some I haaaaaate\" .  That got me wondering if I hated any mechanics.\\n\\nThere are some I like more than others but I couldn't think of any I hate.  The only one I had a problem with multiple times was trading resources. There have been times when a \"couple\" would make really unfair trades with each other. It was obvious the female was trading to make her husband happy.  Fortunately I am good enough friends with them to point this out. I even found a short podcast on this subject and played it for them. The term they used was \"lioning\".\\n\\nBut I believe this was instances of people abusing/not playing as intended not the mechanic.\\n\\nI have a friends wife that refuses to play auction games. I just don't get it. Why? I'm guessing it's because she's not good at it. \\n\\nAre there mechanics you hate and why? What mechanics do you hate and why?\n",

Whatever they do (or don't do) will attract criticism. It's too bad the Iceberg box was not conceived (or maybe possible) from the beginning to avoid waste and extra expense.\\n\\nFor me, personally, the value does not match the cost for either, so I will be passing on their latest offers. Frostpunk backers, are you buying the wooden building meeples and/or Iceberg box? Why or why not?\n",

Space base is genius, especially for a person like myself that loves hitting craps tables. Shy Pluto expansion makes it that much better. The wife loves point salad and the kids 5 and 9 love playing both. We have played either of these every night for the past 2 weeks and are loving it. \\n\\nI just ordered cubitos and can’t wait to dive into that.\\n\\nAEG is killing it for us when it comes to games that peak our interest. Any others from that publisher we should look into? And do the folks here have a favorite publisher they want to mention? I think AEG might have just become my favorite publisher\n",
