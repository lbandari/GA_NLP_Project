I want to use them in my game, but I don't want to get into any legal trouble. So I wonder: for something like this, what is the legality of using screenshots on the cards? Do I have to get a license or can I just use it under fair use? Is it legal to use screenshots from video games in a homebrew card/board game?\n",

My group has played the backside (no pattern) and a few of us have gotten to the point where we cant finish a row or column because we can no longer put that color of tile there.

       "9     [Don't judge my stacking!](https://i.imgur.com/mVnpsOv.jpg)\\n\\nI started in October of 2018 with highly recommended games such as 7 Wonders Duel, Carcassonne, and Fox in the Forest. I think my girlfriend bought Splendor for us as well, but none of these games stuck. Carcassonne sits at a 3/10 for me while Fox in the Forest is a 4. 7WD and Splendor are both decent but I fell off and didn't play any games in 2019. In 2020 I decided to try Spirit Island, my first holy grail. I had been putting it off due to the difficulty but I had nothing to lose so I just went for it.\\n\\nI still haven't played Spirit Island as much as I would like but I finally hit on some games in the months to follow.\\n\\n2020 Hits:\\n\\nSpirit Island (7),\\nCodenames Duet (7) - most played to this date,\\nHanamijoki (10),\\nArboretum (7),\\nThe Mind (7),\\nBaseball Highlights 2045 (9),\\nCockroach Poker (8),\\nSpace Hulk: Death Angel (8),\\nDecrypto (7),\\nDinogenics (7),\\nWatergate (8),\\nLike 5 Buttonshy games (7s),\\nChinatown (8),\\nThe Bloody Inn (7)\\n\\nIn this time I sorta hit on Dominion (I loved this until I got further down my hits list. I find I fall in love with a game and then a previous 10 gets downgraded and shifts my entire system of tiers down a notch lol)\\n\\nThis also happened with Robinson Crusoe and to a lesser extent Nemo's War. Once I found less fiddly solo games (to be mentioned later) I traded these away but they were important stepping stones.\\n\\nKingdomino, Lost Cities, Agricola: ACAB, Biblios, Bonanza: The Duel and The Lost Expedition were all fine but I gifted them away as I tried to keep a \"higher standard\" for my enjoyment.\\n\\nSo I probably went through buying around 40 games in the second half of 2020 but 2021 is when I hit on the backbone of my favorites list now.\\n\\nFirst, I hit on Cosmic Encounter (10) which is by far my favorite game to play with others. I then got a great deal on everything Aeon's End (9) and played through all the sets way too much.\\n\\nI also hit on:\\nPax Pamir 2e (7),\\nDeception: Murder in Hong Kong (8),\\nShadows in Kyoto (8),\\nDungeon Petz (8),\\nRa (8),\\nWavelength (8),\\nAfter the Virus (8),\\nFlamme Rouge (9),\\nObsession (9)\\n\\nBut my two favorite solo have been Darkest Night 2e and Mage Knight. Both 10s. Although, I don't have a victory between the two of them.\\n\\nI don't have much I want to change, because I waited until I found a good stopping point (for now ☺️), but my next buys will be some combo of Innovation, Agricola, Star Wars: Rebellion, and Targi.\\n\\nAlso waiting on a couple Buttonshy Kickstarters, the new Aeon's End, and Maquis.\\n\\n-\\n\\nI would like to thank the stimulus checks for the funds and not having to work for the time to play, but funnily enough what stopped me for now is my desire to stop having to learn rulebooks. I fear I'm running out of room in my head and I'd like to know all my games decently.\\n\\nI already feel like I mentioned more games than I needed to so [HERE](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/tripleblacktri?own=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1) is my profile if you're still interested!\\n\\nAlso, I'm curious what outside opinions of my collection are. Like I think I know what I like at this point but I'm curious what you guys see on my shelves and if you have further recommendations among those lines. :) [COMC] For the first time in months I don't have a package on the way...

       "9      Don t judge my stacking    mVnpsOv jpg  I started in October of 2018 with highly recommended games such as 7 Wonders Duel  Carcassonne  and Fox in the Forest  I think my girlfriend bought Splendor for us as well  but none of these games stuck  Carcassonne sits at a 3 10 for me while Fox in the Forest is a 4  7WD and Splendor are both decent but I fell off and didn t play any games in 2019  In 2020 I decided to try Spirit Island  my first holy grail  I had been putting it off due to the difficulty but I had nothing to lose so I just went for it  I still haven t played Spirit Island as much as I would like but I finally hit on some games in the months to follow  2020 Hits  Spirit Island  7  \\nCodenames Duet  7    most played to this date \\nHanamijoki  10  \\nArboretum  7  \\nThe Mind  7  \\nBaseball Highlights 2045  9  \\nCockroach Poker  8  \\nSpace Hulk  Death Angel  8  \\nDecrypto  7  \\nDinogenics  7  \\nWatergate  8  \\nLike 5 Buttonshy games  7s  \\nChinatown  8  \\nThe Bloody Inn  7  In this time I sorta hit on Dominion  I loved this until I got further down my hits list  I find I fall in love with a game and then a previous 10 gets downgraded and shifts my entire system of tiers down a notch lol  This also happened with Robinson Crusoe and to a lesser extent Nemo s War  Once I found less fiddly solo games  to be mentioned later  I traded these away but they were important stepping stones  Kingdomino  Lost Cities  Agricola  ACAB  Biblios  Bonanza  The Duel and The Lost Expedition were all fine but I gifted them away as I tried to keep a  higher standard  for my enjoyment  So I probably went through buying around 40 games in the second half of 2020 but 2021 is when I hit on the backbone of my favorites list now  First  I hit on Cosmic Encounter  10  which is by far my favorite game to play with others  I then got a great deal on everything Aeon s End  9  and played through all the sets way too much  I also hit on \\nPax Pamir 2e  7  \\nDeception  Murder in Hong Kong  8  \\nShadows in Kyoto  8  \\nDungeon Petz  8  \\nRa  8  \\nWavelength  8  \\nAfter the Virus  8  \\nFlamme Rouge  9  \\nObsession  9  But my two favorite solo have been Darkest Night 2e and Mage Knight  Both 10s  Although  I don t have a victory between the two of them  I don t have much I want to change  because I waited until I found a good stopping point  for now      but my next buys will be some combo of Innovation  Agricola  Star Wars  Rebellion  and Targi  Also waiting on a couple Buttonshy Kickstarters  the new Aeon s End  and Maquis    I would like to thank the stimulus checks for the funds and not having to work for the time to play  but funnily enough what stopped me for now is my desire to stop having to learn rulebooks  I fear I m running out of room in my head and I d like to know all my games decently  I already feel like I mentioned more games than I needed to so  HERE   collection user tripleblacktri own 1 amp subtype boardgame amp ff 1  is my profile if you re still interested  Also  I m curious what outside opinions of my collection are  Like I think I know what I like at this point but I m curious what you guys see on my shelves and if you have further recommendations among those lines      COMC  For the first time in months I don t have a package on the way    Lend me your opinion \n",
