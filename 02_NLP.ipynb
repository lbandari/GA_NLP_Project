       "9     Dont judge my stackingmVnpsOvjpgI started in October of 2018 with highly recommended games such as 7 Wonders Duel Carcassonne and Fox in the Forest I think my girlfriend bought Splendor for us as well but none of these games stuck Carcassonne sits at a 310 for me while Fox in the Forest is a 4 7WD and Splendor are both decent but I fell off and didnt play any games in 2019 In 2020 I decided to try Spirit Island my first holy grail I had been putting it off due to the difficulty but I had nothing to lose so I just went for itI still havent played Spirit Island as much as I would like but I finally hit on some games in the months to follow2020 HitsSpirit Island 7\\nCodenames Duet 7  most played to this date\\nHanamijoki 10\\nArboretum 7\\nThe Mind 7\\nBaseball Highlights 2045 9\\nCockroach Poker 8\\nSpace Hulk Death Angel 8\\nDecrypto 7\\nDinogenics 7\\nWatergate 8\\nLike 5 Buttonshy games 7s\\nChinatown 8\\nThe Bloody Inn 7In this time I sorta hit on Dominion I loved this until I got further down my hits list I find I fall in love with a game and then a previous 10 gets downgraded and shifts my entire system of tiers down a notch lolThis also happened with Robinson Crusoe and to a lesser extent Nemos War Once I found less fiddly solo games to be mentioned later I traded these away but they were important stepping stonesKingdomino Lost Cities Agricola ACAB Biblios Bonanza The Duel and The Lost Expedition were all fine but I gifted them away as I tried to keep a higher standard for my enjoymentSo I probably went through buying around 40 games in the second half of 2020 but 2021 is when I hit on the backbone of my favorites list nowFirst I hit on Cosmic Encounter 10 which is by far my favorite game to play with others I then got a great deal on everything Aeons End 9 and played through all the sets way too muchI also hit on\\nPax Pamir 2e 7\\nDeception Murder in Hong Kong 8\\nShadows in Kyoto 8\\nDungeon Petz 8\\nRa 8\\nWavelength 8\\nAfter the Virus 8\\nFlamme Rouge 9\\nObsession 9But my two favorite solo have been Darkest Night 2e and Mage Knight Both 10s Although I dont have a victory between the two of themI dont have much I want to change because I waited until I found a good stopping point for now  but my next buys will be some combo of Innovation Agricola Star Wars Rebellion and TargiAlso waiting on a couple Buttonshy Kickstarters the new Aeons End and MaquisI would like to thank the stimulus checks for the funds and not having to work for the time to play but funnily enough what stopped me for now is my desire to stop having to learn rulebooks I fear Im running out of room in my head and Id like to know all my games decentlyI already feel like I mentioned more games than I needed to so HEREcollectionusertripleblacktriown1ampsubtypeboardgameampff1 is my profile if youre still interestedAlso Im curious what outside opinions of my collection are Like I think I know what I like at this point but Im curious what you guys see on my shelves and if you have further recommendations among those lines COMC For the first time in months I dont have a package on the way Lend me your opinion\n",
