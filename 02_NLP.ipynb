Someone posted \"there are mechanics I love and some I haaaaaate\" .  That got me wondering if I hated any mechanics.\\n\\nThere are some I like more than others but I couldn't think of any I hate.  The only one I had a problem with multiple times was trading resources. There have been times when a \"couple\" would make really unfair trades with each other. It was obvious the female was trading to make her husband happy.  Fortunately I am good enough friends with them to point this out. I even found a short podcast on this subject and played it for them. The term they used was \"lioning\".\\n\\nBut I believe this was instances of people abusing/not playing as intended not the mechanic.\\n\\nI have a friends wife that refuses to play auction games. I just don't get it. Why? I'm guessing it's because she's not good at it. \\n\\nAre there mechanics you hate and why? What mechanics do you hate and why?\n",

Whatever they do (or don't do) will attract criticism. It's too bad the Iceberg box was not conceived (or maybe possible) from the beginning to avoid waste and extra expense.\\n\\nFor me, personally, the value does not match the cost for either, so I will be passing on their latest offers. Frostpunk backers, are you buying the wooden building meeples and/or Iceberg box? Why or why not?\n",

I was surprised at how many of the stores I called that had no idea what game I was talking about. Was the game not popular when it was published? Is there enough demand now that it could a get a print run? Is Fields of Arle likely to be reprinted?\n",

innovative game mechanics I have come across while expanding my collection:\\n\\nMicro-Macro Crime City was something special with its detective-through-time idea.\\n\\nI have a high respect for the auction style in Keyflower.\\n\\nAnd I love the unique “cheating” rules of Schummel Hummel (Cheating Bee) as you ditch cards up your sleeve or behind your back!\\n\\nI wanted to reach out and see what unique mechanisms (possible game recommendations) you all have come across these past few years that are near and dear and fascinating to your board gaming hearts!\\n\\nMany thanks for everything this subreddit does and is! 👍 Innovative and Fresh Mechanics, anyone?\n",

Space base is genius, especially for a person like myself that loves hitting craps tables. Shy Pluto expansion makes it that much better. The wife loves point salad and the kids 5 and 9 love playing both. We have played either of these every night for the past 2 weeks and are loving it. \\n\\nI just ordered cubitos and can’t wait to dive into that.\\n\\nAEG is killing it for us when it comes to games that peak our interest. Any others from that publisher we should look into? And do the folks here have a favorite publisher they want to mention? I think AEG might have just become my favorite publisher\n",

The one problem we had is that we didn’t know what mesmerizing did. I tried looking it up in the rules and looking online but I couldn’t find anything. Anyone know what the actual mechanic is supposed to do in game. We just said that we would skip our next turn but that felt wrong. Betrayal at House on the Hill Question\n",

       "17    I'll be the first to admit that game has its flaws. And I also understand that, like many games, it's simply just not going to be for everyone. But in my admittedly limited experience, I haven't found many games that I enjoy quite as much. Here are the reasons I personally love it, and why many people probably won't. \\n\\n*1. Balance:*\\n\\n*Why it's good:*\\n\\nThis is a tricky one, because of the plethora of house rules that many people consider necessary to enjoy the game, but in general, the closer you stick to the rules as written, the more you realize just how impeccably balanced this game can be. In a challenging encounter, you're almost always balanced on a knife's edge of success and failure. The choices you make each turn can have significant effects on how easy or how difficult the encounter is, and how many resources you wind up using to defeat it.\\n\\n*Why it's bad:*\\n\\nEven with its (in my opinion) impeccable balance, the game has its flaws. The item deck and the inherent repetitiveness get old quickly, and this is where house rules come in. But many of the popular house rules I see can inherently throw off the balance and chances of failure, typically in the favor of the players. This difficulty of modifying the game to be \"more fun\" while maintaining the knife's edge balance means that this game can be incredibly tricky to house rule properly while maintaining the intended level of challenge. \\n \\n\\n*2. Difficulty*\\n\\n*Why it's good:*\\n\\nThe knife's edge of success and failure means one thing. You will almost certainly fail at some point. Possibly quite frequently.  This very real chance of failure adds a massive level of tension to many decisions and moments throughout the game. I love it, because I don't want my success to be handed to me. I want to earn it by learning from mistakes and failures. \\n\\n*Why it's bad:*\\n\\nDying and having to start back at the bonfire can feel especially unfun and unrewarding to many players. It's an unfortunate side effect of the challenge of the game and the Dark Souls formula it's built upon. This is perhaps one of the primary reasons this game simply isn't going to be for everyone. If you're not someone that's ok with \"feels bad failure\" then you're just not going to enjoy this game as it was made to be experienced. \\n\\n\\n*3. The Dice*\\n\\n*Why it's good:*\\n\\nWhile there is some randomness in the dice rolling element, this simply means that on each turn, you need to be weighing the probability and cost of a bad roll, and make your decisions accordingly. Often times it's simply a better decision for the dodge focused character to try to block a hit, because a poor roll on the block will leave you standing, but a failed dodge will kill you. This number crunching based strategy is something I personally enjoy quite a bit. \\n\\n*Why it's bad:*\\n\\nI see many people complain that the dice add too much randomness into the game. I would argue that it's not simply pure randomness, it's probability. However, many people aren't the type who are going to enjoy calculating and weighing the  probabilities and costs of success or failure on each turn for each of their choices. So if you're the type of person who just dislikes the \"randomness of dice\" then you probably won't enjoy this game very much. \\n\\n\\n*4. Simplicity*\\n\\n*Why it's good:*\\n\\nWhile the game certainly can't be considered \"simple\" I've found that the rules are incredibly quick and easy to pick up. Getting someone started and understanding just about every element they need to to properly play takes easily less than 20 minutes. And I was even capable of running the game myself after playing it twice without ever having to look at the rule book. For my tastes, this is an almost necessary component for a game to be enjoyable. I hate being bogged down by overwhelming number of rules and rule complexity. \\n\\n*Why it's bad:*\\n\\nIf you want complex, or if you want a clear and concisely written, well organized rulebook to sink your teeth into, then this game is not for you. The rulebook's organization is probably the single most frustrating aspect of the game. On the rare occasion that you do need to look up a ruling, good luck finding it. \\n\\n*The verdict:*\\n\\nOverall I think the game succeeds quite well in what it sets out to be, but that success does come at a cost. And the game itself is not without its flaws. The repetitiveness, the item deck, and the rulebook stand out as the top three to me. These issues can be mitigated with proper house rules, but maintaining the balance and challenge while incorporating custom rules is difficult. \\n\\nIf you want a game that's primarily focused on balance and difficulty, then this game just might be for you. On the other hand, if you want a fun, dungeon delving, blast through your enemies with fireballs and awesome attacks type of experience, this game is going to feel incredibly inferior to other options out there, because that's simply not what it is trying to be.
