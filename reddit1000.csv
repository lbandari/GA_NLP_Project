2,boardgames,"Hi! I want to rebuy this beloved game from my childhood.

Genre: Dungeon based game in which on every turn you move with a dice toss and depending on the step you land there's a down-sided monster card on top of a treasure.

the way you beat the monsters I can't remember exactly, might be the old , ""you need more than X dice roll to kill it""   
but what I do remember is that the objective was to collect most , or as many as possible ""ring cards"" that also played as treasure cards hidden under monster cards. As far as I remember there might be Dragon monster cards which were the strongest, don't remember if they were always set on top of ring cards.

So, as I said , it was very ring-based, not to be confused with any LOTR specific game.

3,boardgames,"just got into a “lively” exchange about what is considered “playing” a monster card. based on the mechanism in gift of the elements where you can add monster cards to players decks and the wording of several cards, it would seem that if a monster card is in your hand it will be played when you put it down at your turn. now playing a monster card is pointless unless of course an event card like xeron’s trial is active. 

for anyone familiar with ascension gift of the elements, what is your thought on this? i know the game is a bit older now, is there official guidance on this?","ascenion xeron’s trial, what is considered monster played"

It's been a long journey.  Six years.  I discovered this passion in my second year of college, and now well graduated, my collection is stronger than ever.  
My friends started playing Catan in highschool.  Soon enough, I got it and hooked everyone.  Next was the Munchkin craze.  Everyone was blasting Munchkin at every gathering.  Once my Munchkin phase was over, that's when I got really invested into the board gaming scene.  Binging Rahdo, Watch it Played, and SUSD, all day, to research every new game and it's rules.  I love this hobby because I get to share it with everyone I know.  I see them discover my joy, and find their own.  We create our own culture, Meta, and vocabulary for our games.

**Favorite games:**    
Root, Cosmic Encounter, Kemet, Android: Netrunner, Gaia Project, Caverna    
    
**Proudest Game in Collection:**      
My entire, completed collection of the original Netrunner, by FFG    
    
**Players:**    
I have many game circles, all people I know personally.  My fiancé and I explore two players.  My cousins meet occasionally to discover more of my games, even with their toddlers disturbing us.  My college buddies are the most hardcore gamers.  We rarely get together, due to them still being in school, but I can drop a new heavy Euro, and they'll gobble it up in no time.    
**What would you change about your collection if you could?**    
I made a ton of bad buys, and games I never touched.  I eventually sold them.  I'd fall into the trap of new, hyped games, when a classic has already done the same.  I would focus more on heavier euros, and more elegant, complex games from the start.  I'd only need a few simple, well-rounded, classics for me to introduce new players.","[COMC] Big collection, 6 Years into the hobby and a new shelf"
6,boardgames,"My best friend Jay and I have really gotten into escape room games at home during this pandemic. We have gotten together twice and played two Hunt a Killer seasons and five Deadbolt Mystery Society Boxes. (We dont want to subscribe to anything so we've been getting past seasons or one time boxes.) We also played an Exit the last time we got together and really liked it. We have done 2 Exit games over zoom and found that it works really well for us when we can't get together. (We live several hours apart). 

We are planning a get together in May and I've been looking into other boxed set companies and the Unlock games. 

Anyone with experience with escape room games at home either with murder mystery boxed sets like Hunt a Killer or Exit games have any other recommendations for things we could play together?

I'm looking into:
Unlock
The Conundrum Box
Escape the Crate
Sleuth Kings 

But am very open to any and all other suggestions.

We are quickly working through the Exit series over zoom as we want to play at least every other week. (We each buy our own box and since Exit is cheap it has been pretty affordable) I'm also wondering if Unlock will work as well via zoom. Or what other games would work well via zoom.

11,boardgames,"I was just asked a question about Clank In Space regarding what happens when there isn't any cubes left in the bag.

The one player got in, grabbed an artifact and headed back out. She died prior to getting into a pod, but would still be counting. The other player was slower and hadn't got the artifact yet, but had built the deck with enough clank removal and healing that they eventually got down to just the 2 red cubes remaining in the bag. Even after this player picked up their artifact it wouldn't push them to the top level, so they wouldn't have 4 red cubes in the bag.

Now I looked in the rules and there doesn't seem to be anything in there regarding this. The rules say the player should pull 6 cubes in a 2 player game. But do they just stop if they pull the 2 red cubes then put them back in? Or is there some other option where they refresh the bag and pull 6 red cubes?

Hey,

I've had my eyes on Catacombs as my first dexterity game for quite a while. Their Kickstarter launched a few days ago, and will end in 3 days already. Now, since I might as well buy the retail edition for about 60% of the price, could someone elaborate if the game (and the stretch goals) is/are worth it overall, and if the playmats are better than the retail boards? I heard that the edges don't really stick down, and that stickers (?) may leave uneven spots.

Also, is the enormous price gap between the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX"" pledge (130CA$) and the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX PLUS"" pledge (340 CA$) reflected in what you get out of the extra stuff in your opinion?

And on a side note, should I even bother to get Catacombs, or is Crokinole that much better?

38,boardgames,"A few months ago, I really started to get into chess. I really liked the idea of a miniature battlefield with tons of tactics and openings while still keeping it simple. So I decided that it would be fun to make one. In its current state it is playable but I bet there is room for development.

Note: Explaining this on text is hard. The game is actually really simple but all the cordinate stuff may  make it look confusing.

I call it ""Emerald Game"" or just ""Emerald"". It is a two player game played on a square 10 by 10 board which is roughly 900cm²(When writing coordinates, the x axis comes first. Eg: (x,y).). Players can either play as red or blue (Red always starts first). Each player has 7(actually 6) different pieces at their disposal. The objective is to eliminate your opponent's chateau, which is the most valuable piece, in the sense that if they lose it they just lose the game. You can do this by either crushing it or throwing it off the board.

 Yes! You can throw pieces in this. The throwing mechanic is really simple but when you first hear it, you might get confused. So let me explain.

 When a piece that gets on a square that is already occupied by another piece, regardless of color, the original piece that was on the square will get thrown differently depending on which piece threw it. I will explain this better after I introduce the pieces.

Note: I made the board out of a strong cardboard and made every piece by some play dough which I hardened.

\---------The Pieces--------

Note: Pieces can be eliminated by getting thrown off the board or by getting crushed by a chateau.

Note: A player can intentionally walk off their pieces off the board.

(1x)Chateau:

\*When a game starts, the red chateau is placed at (5,5) and the blue chateau is placed at (6,6)

\*When a player's chateau is eliminated, it is game over for them.

\*Can not move by itself.

\*The chateau can spawn any piece that hasn't been eliminated or spawned before in a 5x5 square that it is in the center of. 

\*If thrown, the first piece the chateau bumps into both stops the chateau and directly eliminates the piece it bumped into. (This is an ability that only the chateau has)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Gladiator:

\*Can only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If it gets on a square that is already occupied, it throws the piece occypying it either 2 squares to the left or 2 squares to the right. (Lets say there is a gladiator on (3,3) and it moves to (4,3) where a chateau was standing. Now it throws to chateau to either (4,5) or (4,1))

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Bull:

\*It can see all the way to the north, south, east and west. Can normally only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a bull is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,1) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,1) which are (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,1). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Ram:

(Basically a diagonal bull)

\*It can see all the way to the northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. Can normally only move northeast, southeast, northeast and southwest one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a ram is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,5) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,5) which are (2,2), (3,3) and (4,4). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,8). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wall:

\*Can't do anything.

\*Seriously

\*Doesn't mean its useless tho

\*It can block like rams or bulls or soften a throw(I will tell you about that)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wizard:

\*Can see all the way to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can move only one square to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can pull the first piece it has vision on right next to itself (Lets say a wizard is on (2,2) , there is a wall on (5,5) and a ram on (2,8). The wizard can pull the wall to (3,3) or pull the ram to (2,3).)

\*Pushes pieces only one square.

\*Can be placable for both players only after a chateau regardless of color gets thrown.

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Giant(it is currently not legal, waiting for suggestions)

\*Can see and move to the north, south, west, east, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest only one square

\*Has unlimited throwing power, it will make every piece go flying.

Yeah I made this piece but never used it. It is currently banned because it is too overpowered. The purpose of the giant was to keep the action maximum in every position. It was originally only able to be spawned after a player's every single piece had been eliminated. But I noticed that getting rid of every piece is VERY hard even when you do it intentionally. The piece still exist with some scrapped ideas but I would like to see what other people think it may be good for.

&amp;#x200B;

\-But wait! Yeah pieces can throw each other but what happens if a piece bumps into another piece when it arrives at its destined square?

It just makes the other piece move 1 square the direction it bumped in

\-But what if bumps in to another piece while it is still on the way to its destined square?

It makes the piece it bumped move 1 square and it becomes the new occupier of the square 

&amp;#x200B;

Those principles apply to throwing.

47,boardgames,"So, I’ve been doing YouTube how to play videos, solo playthroughs and things of that nature. 

I’m about to get into doing reviews as well, and I was curious, for anyone reading this what question gets answered for you in a board game review. 

Do you watch reviews for the entertainment aspect?

Maybe you’re watching to learn if a particular game has any mechanics that you might like. 

Or maybe you want to know if the reviewer your watching likes the game and would recommend it. 

I’m sure people watch reviews, how to plays and other board game content for a myriad of reasons, but I’m curious what are you hoping to learn from a review. 

Also, I’m curious as to what sort of format you like to see in reviews. Do you like reviews that are super structured, for example. 

“Today we are reviewing Everdell, and in this review I’m going to break it down for you by theme, art, quality, player interaction, gameplay, etc etc....”

Or do you prefer a more free flowing style where the reviewer literally just jumps from topic to topic in no real formal way, talking to the camera as if trying to sell a friend on how good or bad a game is. 

Also what do you feel about a letter or number score as opposed to “I recommend or do not recommend this game”

And lastly, do you like a more objective review or subjective. Ie, I could say objectively Lost Ruins of Arnak is a great game. The mechanics at play really mesh well together m, bla bla bla. But subjectively, I don’t like it because of A, B, and C. (I actually love Arnak, but just as an example)",Do you watch board game reviews and what question gets answered for you?

52,boardgames,"During the pandemic, my beloved hobby of playing board games with friends (at the table) has been, as I guess for many others in here, pretty much dead. I just re-arranged all my board games in a new shelf and got this idea; what if we could play board games over a conference call / video live with everyone participating from home. I have a lot of friends and colleagues that wants to play, but I’m the one with the games. Meaning we need to play with only one copy of the game. 

I’m really curious if anyone have tried this - in that case what game and how did it go?
If not, then do you have any ideas on what games that could work and how this could be done?

I’m thinking party games in general should be fine, some deduction games and maybe puzzle / mystery solving etc. Hidden roles can be done by showing a card to each player while all others close their eyes / camera. Some coop-games should work fine if all information is public. 

I’m thinking to set up a camera that films the table for everyone to see. Also it could be possible to use regular dice and playing cards as component replacements as I expect everyone to have this at disposal.

One thing that will not work is holding a hidden deck/cards/etc. for players. Open decks could be placed in «player areas» on the table and be shown on camera, so this should work fine.

Note: Please dont recommend apps, PC-games etc. as alternatives. I know and use these, but I want to try this concept with the «real deal»!

Out of my collection I’m thinking these could maybe work:
• Camel Up
• Castles of Burgundy
• Chronicles of Crime
• Codenames (each clue-giver takes a screenshot of the answer card)
• Ghost Stories
• Hey, That’s my Fish
• Magic Maze (this is probably too hard to coordinate)
• Mysterium
• One Night Ultimate Werewolf (maybe without some roles / game master)
• Pandemic
• Ricochet Robots
• Scotland Yard
• Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective
• Small World
• Telestrations
• When I Dream

HONKTOPIA: Illuminati New World Order: Open Source Community Edition: A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

Premier fully functional + meta balanced hyper-compressible meta-memeplex psycho-cultural-alchemic-memetic technology that uses neurolinguistics, hyper-juxtaposition, and  other methods to circumvent synthetic epistemics while programming the players into a 4g/5g warfare psycho-spiritual frame. It exploits memetic virality and asymmetric  psychological-archetypal memetic feedback loops. It takes the form of a trading card game, but it is so, so much more. This is the full 501 card set, and comes with a custom box artwork file (pictured). This is the first of its kind to offer meritocratic access to the zeitgeist. It is a memetic snapshot of 2020. A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

CULTURE WINS WARS. STR33T 4LCH3MY.

Illuminati New World Order set out to expose via card gamification, the World Gamification. The resistance towards and stickiness of the idea means these projects are over the target. The other 4chan and INWO projects always seem to fail, for whatever reason. So I decided to take it upon myself, so there would be no excuse not to complete it. I designed this game as a psycho-cultural-spiritual-memetic weapon-seed-ark. The idea is to train people into an effective perspective, while bringing their memeplex up to date, all abstracted under lulz. I offer this so that you might have content to freely offer someone else and engage with them. The idea is to have the gateway be ""like forbidden lulz??"", and then break the programming implicitly through hyper juxtaposition and archetypal drift. It's content, at minimum. Print them if you want.

This is an open source community project. I want it to run off crypto to combat revisionism and to pay the anons who contribute powerful memes, automatically. This is a method to construct culture meritocratically and transparently, on any scale. Think of the cards as ""culture units"", and their addition to the game as an ""operating body"", upon which the wider ""real"" games that are downstream of culture units are based on. We have reached a phase of development where the 'salt of the earth' makes the best culture(memes), because we are the ones who shoulder shoulder suffering. You'd need military grade training and still often make less viral memes then organic ones (without artificial power-structure support). Essentially, think of this of a movie (culture), of which The People pick the constituent archetypes, scene by scene, in realtime. It's everything a government is sans the bureaucracy, logistics, and corruption. This is a truly unique and interesting cultural artifact.

The information war is a rigged game. We lose by consenting/playing the rigged game, we win by setting the game. Were not in an information war, it's closer to a knowledge war, which may might seem even more daunting, but creativity can be a big player here (vs battling big tech), and if we start playing the knowledge game while they're still playing information game, they won't be able to compete, because their entire empire is based on manipulating information, and if they were to try and train their slaves in knowledge warfare, they would end up setting them free.

The information war was lost before it began, due to asymmetric metaphysical limitations. The information war is a farce. Below that is a mystery/gnostic/luciferian power structure based on the manipulation of knowledge. Both the knowledge game and the information game are asymmetric, but in opposite directions, this is why they want people to think this is an information war because it's the only one they can win.

 Plays like a mixture between yugioh, INWO, and Magic. Most similar to Magic, except ""memes"" have a board locality (""virulence"") mechanic which indicates how far the ""effect"" of the Meme jumps to adjacent connected targets. Infrastructure is like a ""defender"" creature in Magic, except that it also has health. Infrastructure of corresponding resource color is required to play 7+ resource cost Anthropos (creatures), indicated by the golden dragon around their rightmost cost (alternatively you must ""offer/sacrifice"" an Anthropos from the Matrix). Avatars determine your ""Time"" (life points) for the game, the unique win condition, and your special ability for the entire game. This way, 2 decks with the same cards but different Avatars can employ completely different strategies and have different objectives. Memes are essentially spells. Board position is important. Can be quickly and intuitively learned with prior Magic and or Yugioh experience. Built to be intuitive, totally circumventing epistemics and transcending rationality.

Deck = SOUL

Field = MATRIX  
Zone = MATRIX POTENTIAL  
Play = EXECUTE  
Life Points = TIME  
Attack = INFLUENCE  
Defend = RESIST  
Discard = FORGET  
Tap = EXHAUST  
Untap = AWAKEN  
Target = IDENTIFY  
Discard Pile = HISTORY  
Removed From Game = VOID  
Destroy = DELETE

HAND = HAND

This game solves the main problems of INWO:

\-No barrier to entry, free digital (email me, PHYSICAL version for collectors)

\-Open to and requesting input from community, this is for The People  
\-greatly simplified rules, with even more concentrated knowledge  
\-up to date/real time memetic response  
\-Real memes/art/pictures  
\-BOTH backwards and forwards compatible!!! (1800-2100AD+)  
\-I consider this game to be ""revealed"" to me, as the nearly complete plans/rules/concept/theory/implications/instructions just showed up in my head and started to demand to come out. Make of that what you will. Some Terry Davis type jazz. If any Good comes of this, all credit to the Divine.

Card Types:

Anthropos - (""creatures+"")  
Resources - (""Mana""+)  
Memes - (""spells""+)  
Avatars - (""heroes"")  
Infrastructure ? (""defenders""+)

Resource Types:

Blackmail -  
Attention -  
Crypto -  
Metal -  
Cash - \[Worth 3x resources, does not ""untap"" during awaken phase\]  
Market -

Full Set Distribution: (all unique)

Anthropos: \~25 each resource color  
Memes: \~35 each resource color  
Avatars: 14 total.  
Infrastructure: \~10 each resource color  
Resources: \~ 7 of each color

\-Cards are the same size as in Magic the Gathering, 2.5x3.5in

\-All cards are equally rare.

Some have suggested that these may used in the same way tarot is. I'm not a degenerate pagan, but I can say that the card #s were about 90% randomly assigned, completed and digitally released on 12/31/2020-1/1/2021. When I posted this online I got consecutive dubs, dubs, double dubs, immediately locked out of the site with a never before seen false error message, hours later the physical cards were delivered 4!!! days early. I can attest that the synchronistic anomalies with this thing are stubbornly awesome, persistent, too long to list. This tool is a mustard seed, a most peculiar cultural artifact, it is a mechanism to use asymmetric memetic feedback loops to immunize the zeitgeist from synthetic epistemics or ""order out chaos"". It is a sword, a seed, a flower, an ark, and a rock.

**My Background**  
At home when I (34M) we mainly played 2 types of boardgames: roll and move (monoply, the goose game, ...) and knowledge based games (trivial pursuit, some dutch dictionanry game, ...). While I liked playing with my family board gaming was not my main favourite activity.  
Later in my life Catan came out and I was triggered a bit more, because (for me at the time) this game had theme. But when I played it the first time, I was about 11 years old, very unaware that board gaming was considered a hobby. So during the years I played mainly with my family the same games.  
Until about 4-5 years ago I bought “Legends of Andor”, this was the real eye opener for me a game that, after all the others, had so much theme in it. I played through all the scenarios in 3 days or so. After that I weant on searching for something that was less of a puzzle and more lets-kill-some-monsters type of game. For that I found Castle Ravenloft, but the real change was during this research finding out about BGG and a lot of Youtube channels about boardgames. All of which led me to the rabbit hole that is the hobby.  
My latest revelation in this is Facebook groups for secondhand games, which does not save me a lot of money but does increase the amount of games I can get for the same amount of cash.

**Player profile**  
My main playing partner is my wife. I like complex games with lots of theme in them and my wife likes more thinkier games with streamlined rulesets.

**Favorite games in collection**  
Mansions of madness (2e), Above and below, Teotihuacan, Raiders of the North Sea; Trickerion

**Newest games in my collection**  
Second hand: Comanauts, Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn, Robinson Crusoe: Andventures on a cursed island

Genre is a very loose term here, where it could mean a particular theme (space, fantasy, etc.) or mechanism or a combination of them and more. For example:

\- Hidden movement

\- Space war

\- Economic euro

\- Heavy Uwe Rosenburg game

And by this, I usually chuck away the inserts, chuck away meaning I slid them in some part of the house as I can NEVER EVER throw them away (for some reason) though useless they are. 

And now as I just purchased Spirit Island, inserts do not take into account sleeved cards (again) and I am thinking this will be another plastic waste that will sleep in some place in my home. I just realized that I want to start throwing inserts to the bin and not keep them. Just do not know how to get my mind into it and how to start. Probably as I feel attached to my stuff, as growing up, we cannot afford the things I want then, and only now as I grew older that I managed to buy things for myself.","Manufacturer Inserts - Rant, What To Do, and Whatever It Is"

It's something of a golden age for the rpging boardgamer, Above and Below, and these epics like 7th Continent and so forth are really scratching that itch.  I am almost spoiled for choice, time was I would have said I've played all that were available, but now, no way.

But back to City of Chaos - I really enjoyed it, and tried to get it to the table a lot.

Genre: Dungeon based game in which on every turn you move with a dice toss and depending on the step you land there's a down-sided monster card on top of a treasure.

the way you beat the monsters I can't remember exactly, might be the old , ""you need more than X dice roll to kill it""   
but what I do remember is that the objective was to collect most , or as many as possible ""ring cards"" that also played as treasure cards hidden under monster cards. As far as I remember there might be Dragon monster cards which were the strongest, don't remember if they were always set on top of ring cards.

So, as I said , it was very ring-based, not to be confused with any LOTR specific game.

2,boardgames,"just got into a “lively” exchange about what is considered “playing” a monster card. based on the mechanism in gift of the elements where you can add monster cards to players decks and the wording of several cards, it would seem that if a monster card is in your hand it will be played when you put it down at your turn. now playing a monster card is pointless unless of course an event card like xeron’s trial is active.

It's been a long journey.  Six years.  I discovered this passion in my second year of college, and now well graduated, my collection is stronger than ever.  
My friends started playing Catan in highschool.  Soon enough, I got it and hooked everyone.  Next was the Munchkin craze.  Everyone was blasting Munchkin at every gathering.  Once my Munchkin phase was over, that's when I got really invested into the board gaming scene.  Binging Rahdo, Watch it Played, and SUSD, all day, to research every new game and it's rules.  I love this hobby because I get to share it with everyone I know.  I see them discover my joy, and find their own.  We create our own culture, Meta, and vocabulary for our games.

**Favorite games:**    
Root, Cosmic Encounter, Kemet, Android: Netrunner, Gaia Project, Caverna    
    
**Proudest Game in Collection:**      
My entire, completed collection of the original Netrunner, by FFG    
    
**Players:**    
I have many game circles, all people I know personally.  My fiancé and I explore two players.  My cousins meet occasionally to discover more of my games, even with their toddlers disturbing us.  My college buddies are the most hardcore gamers.  We rarely get together, due to them still being in school, but I can drop a new heavy Euro, and they'll gobble it up in no time.    
**What would you change about your collection if you could?**    
I made a ton of bad buys, and games I never touched.  I eventually sold them.  I'd fall into the trap of new, hyped games, when a classic has already done the same.  I would focus more on heavier euros, and more elegant, complex games from the start.  I'd only need a few simple, well-rounded, classics for me to introduce new players.","[COMC] Big collection, 6 Years into the hobby and a new shelf"

We have gotten together twice and played two Hunt a Killer seasons and five Deadbolt Mystery Society Boxes.

We have done 2 Exit games over zoom and found that it works really well for us when we can't get together. (We live several hours apart). 

We are planning a get together in May and I've been looking into other boxed set companies and the Unlock games.

Escape the Crate

Even after this player picked up their artifact it wouldn't push them to the top level, so they wouldn't have 4 red cubes in the bag.

Now I looked in the rules and there doesn't seem to be anything in there regarding this. The rules say the player should pull 6 cubes in a 2 player game. But do they just stop if they pull the 2 red cubes then put them back in? Or is there some other option where they refresh the bag and pull 6 red cubes?

Hey,

I've had my eyes on Catacombs as my first dexterity game for quite a while. Their Kickstarter launched a few days ago, and will end in 3 days already. Now, since I might as well buy the retail edition for about 60% of the price, could someone elaborate if the game (and the stretch goals) is/are worth it overall, and if the playmats are better than the retail boards? I heard that the edges don't really stick down, and that stickers (?) may leave uneven spots.

Also, is the enormous price gap between the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX"" pledge (130CA$) and the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX PLUS"" pledge (340 CA$) reflected in what you get out of the extra stuff in your opinion?

And on a side note, should I even bother to get Catacombs, or is Crokinole that much better?

The  game is complicated at first glance but is run by a game master that  deals with that complexity. It is designed so that anyone can sit down  and play. Please send me a PM if you are interested.

But surely there's some solidarity to be found amongst people like me who'd much rather just have some colorful, novelly-shaped wooden pieces than unpainted Happy Meal toys?


I understand that some people enjoy painting minis, and I'm not seriously putting anyone down for what they like. 


The miniatures adoration is just very strange to me, that's all. I legitimately prefer 2d art. The best sculpted plastic that can come in a board game is game trayz.

37,boardgames,"A few months ago, I really started to get into chess. I really liked the idea of a miniature battlefield with tons of tactics and openings while still keeping it simple. So I decided that it would be fun to make one. In its current state it is playable but I bet there is room for development.

Note: Explaining this on text is hard. The game is actually really simple but all the cordinate stuff may  make it look confusing.

I call it ""Emerald Game"" or just ""Emerald"". It is a two player game played on a square 10 by 10 board which is roughly 900cm²(When writing coordinates, the x axis comes first. Eg: (x,y).). Players can either play as red or blue (Red always starts first). Each player has 7(actually 6) different pieces at their disposal. The objective is to eliminate your opponent's chateau, which is the most valuable piece, in the sense that if they lose it they just lose the game. You can do this by either crushing it or throwing it off the board.

 Yes! You can throw pieces in this. The throwing mechanic is really simple but when you first hear it, you might get confused. So let me explain.

 When a piece that gets on a square that is already occupied by another piece, regardless of color, the original piece that was on the square will get thrown differently depending on which piece threw it. I will explain this better after I introduce the pieces.

Note: I made the board out of a strong cardboard and made every piece by some play dough which I hardened.

\---------The Pieces--------

Note: Pieces can be eliminated by getting thrown off the board or by getting crushed by a chateau.

Note: A player can intentionally walk off their pieces off the board.

(1x)Chateau:

\*When a game starts, the red chateau is placed at (5,5) and the blue chateau is placed at (6,6)

\*When a player's chateau is eliminated, it is game over for them.

\*Can not move by itself.

\*The chateau can spawn any piece that hasn't been eliminated or spawned before in a 5x5 square that it is in the center of. 

\*If thrown, the first piece the chateau bumps into both stops the chateau and directly eliminates the piece it bumped into. (This is an ability that only the chateau has)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Gladiator:

\*Can only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If it gets on a square that is already occupied, it throws the piece occypying it either 2 squares to the left or 2 squares to the right. (Lets say there is a gladiator on (3,3) and it moves to (4,3) where a chateau was standing. Now it throws to chateau to either (4,5) or (4,1))

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Bull:

\*It can see all the way to the north, south, east and west. Can normally only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a bull is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,1) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,1) which are (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,1). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Ram:

(Basically a diagonal bull)

\*It can see all the way to the northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. Can normally only move northeast, southeast, northeast and southwest one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a ram is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,5) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,5) which are (2,2), (3,3) and (4,4). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,8). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wall:

\*Can't do anything.

\*Seriously

\*Doesn't mean its useless tho

\*It can block like rams or bulls or soften a throw(I will tell you about that)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wizard:

\*Can see all the way to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can move only one square to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can pull the first piece it has vision on right next to itself (Lets say a wizard is on (2,2) , there is a wall on (5,5) and a ram on (2,8). The wizard can pull the wall to (3,3) or pull the ram to (2,3).)

\*Pushes pieces only one square.

\*Can be placable for both players only after a chateau regardless of color gets thrown.

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Giant(it is currently not legal, waiting for suggestions)

\*Can see and move to the north, south, west, east, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest only one square

\*Has unlimited throwing power, it will make every piece go flying.

Yeah I made this piece but never used it. It is currently banned because it is too overpowered. The purpose of the giant was to keep the action maximum in every position. It was originally only able to be spawned after a player's every single piece had been eliminated. But I noticed that getting rid of every piece is VERY hard even when you do it intentionally. The piece still exist with some scrapped ideas but I would like to see what other people think it may be good for.

&amp;#x200B;

\-But wait! Yeah pieces can throw each other but what happens if a piece bumps into another piece when it arrives at its destined square?

It just makes the other piece move 1 square the direction it bumped in

\-But what if bumps in to another piece while it is still on the way to its destined square?

It makes the piece it bumped move 1 square and it becomes the new occupier of the square 

&amp;#x200B;

Those principles apply to throwing.

46,boardgames,"So, I’ve been doing YouTube how to play videos, solo playthroughs and things of that nature. 

I’m about to get into doing reviews as well, and I was curious, for anyone reading this what question gets answered for you in a board game review. 

Do you watch reviews for the entertainment aspect?

Maybe you’re watching to learn if a particular game has any mechanics that you might like. 

Or maybe you want to know if the reviewer your watching likes the game and would recommend it. 

I’m sure people watch reviews, how to plays and other board game content for a myriad of reasons, but I’m curious what are you hoping to learn from a review. 

Also, I’m curious as to what sort of format you like to see in reviews. Do you like reviews that are super structured, for example. 

“Today we are reviewing Everdell, and in this review I’m going to break it down for you by theme, art, quality, player interaction, gameplay, etc etc....”

Or do you prefer a more free flowing style where the reviewer literally just jumps from topic to topic in no real formal way, talking to the camera as if trying to sell a friend on how good or bad a game is. 

Also what do you feel about a letter or number score as opposed to “I recommend or do not recommend this game”

And lastly, do you like a more objective review or subjective. Ie, I could say objectively Lost Ruins of Arnak is a great game. The mechanics at play really mesh well together m, bla bla bla. But subjectively, I don’t like it because of A, B, and C. (I actually love Arnak, but just as an example)",Do you watch board game reviews and what question gets answered for you?

51,boardgames,"During the pandemic, my beloved hobby of playing board games with friends (at the table) has been, as I guess for many others in here, pretty much dead. I just re-arranged all my board games in a new shelf and got this idea; what if we could play board games over a conference call / video live with everyone participating from home. I have a lot of friends and colleagues that wants to play, but I’m the one with the games. Meaning we need to play with only one copy of the game. 

I’m really curious if anyone have tried this - in that case what game and how did it go?
If not, then do you have any ideas on what games that could work and how this could be done?

I’m thinking party games in general should be fine, some deduction games and maybe puzzle / mystery solving etc. Hidden roles can be done by showing a card to each player while all others close their eyes / camera. Some coop-games should work fine if all information is public. 

I’m thinking to set up a camera that films the table for everyone to see. Also it could be possible to use regular dice and playing cards as component replacements as I expect everyone to have this at disposal.

One thing that will not work is holding a hidden deck/cards/etc. for players. Open decks could be placed in «player areas» on the table and be shown on camera, so this should work fine.

Note: Please dont recommend apps, PC-games etc. as alternatives. I know and use these, but I want to try this concept with the «real deal»!

Out of my collection I’m thinking these could maybe work:
• Camel Up
• Castles of Burgundy
• Chronicles of Crime
• Codenames (each clue-giver takes a screenshot of the answer card)
• Ghost Stories
• Hey, That’s my Fish
• Magic Maze (this is probably too hard to coordinate)
• Mysterium
• One Night Ultimate Werewolf (maybe without some roles / game master)
• Pandemic
• Ricochet Robots
• Scotland Yard
• Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective
• Small World
• Telestrations
• When I Dream

HONKTOPIA: Illuminati New World Order: Open Source Community Edition: A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

Premier fully functional + meta balanced hyper-compressible meta-memeplex psycho-cultural-alchemic-memetic technology that uses neurolinguistics, hyper-juxtaposition, and  other methods to circumvent synthetic epistemics while programming the players into a 4g/5g warfare psycho-spiritual frame. It exploits memetic virality and asymmetric  psychological-archetypal memetic feedback loops. It takes the form of a trading card game, but it is so, so much more. This is the full 501 card set, and comes with a custom box artwork file (pictured). This is the first of its kind to offer meritocratic access to the zeitgeist. It is a memetic snapshot of 2020. A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

CULTURE WINS WARS. STR33T 4LCH3MY.

Illuminati New World Order set out to expose via card gamification, the World Gamification. The resistance towards and stickiness of the idea means these projects are over the target. The other 4chan and INWO projects always seem to fail, for whatever reason. So I decided to take it upon myself, so there would be no excuse not to complete it. I designed this game as a psycho-cultural-spiritual-memetic weapon-seed-ark. The idea is to train people into an effective perspective, while bringing their memeplex up to date, all abstracted under lulz. I offer this so that you might have content to freely offer someone else and engage with them. The idea is to have the gateway be ""like forbidden lulz??"", and then break the programming implicitly through hyper juxtaposition and archetypal drift. It's content, at minimum. Print them if you want.

This is an open source community project. I want it to run off crypto to combat revisionism and to pay the anons who contribute powerful memes, automatically. This is a method to construct culture meritocratically and transparently, on any scale. Think of the cards as ""culture units"", and their addition to the game as an ""operating body"", upon which the wider ""real"" games that are downstream of culture units are based on. We have reached a phase of development where the 'salt of the earth' makes the best culture(memes), because we are the ones who shoulder shoulder suffering. You'd need military grade training and still often make less viral memes then organic ones (without artificial power-structure support). Essentially, think of this of a movie (culture), of which The People pick the constituent archetypes, scene by scene, in realtime. It's everything a government is sans the bureaucracy, logistics, and corruption. This is a truly unique and interesting cultural artifact.

The information war is a rigged game. We lose by consenting/playing the rigged game, we win by setting the game. Were not in an information war, it's closer to a knowledge war, which may might seem even more daunting, but creativity can be a big player here (vs battling big tech), and if we start playing the knowledge game while they're still playing information game, they won't be able to compete, because their entire empire is based on manipulating information, and if they were to try and train their slaves in knowledge warfare, they would end up setting them free.

The information war was lost before it began, due to asymmetric metaphysical limitations. The information war is a farce. Below that is a mystery/gnostic/luciferian power structure based on the manipulation of knowledge. Both the knowledge game and the information game are asymmetric, but in opposite directions, this is why they want people to think this is an information war because it's the only one they can win.

 Plays like a mixture between yugioh, INWO, and Magic. Most similar to Magic, except ""memes"" have a board locality (""virulence"") mechanic which indicates how far the ""effect"" of the Meme jumps to adjacent connected targets. Infrastructure is like a ""defender"" creature in Magic, except that it also has health. Infrastructure of corresponding resource color is required to play 7+ resource cost Anthropos (creatures), indicated by the golden dragon around their rightmost cost (alternatively you must ""offer/sacrifice"" an Anthropos from the Matrix). Avatars determine your ""Time"" (life points) for the game, the unique win condition, and your special ability for the entire game. This way, 2 decks with the same cards but different Avatars can employ completely different strategies and have different objectives. Memes are essentially spells. Board position is important. Can be quickly and intuitively learned with prior Magic and or Yugioh experience. Built to be intuitive, totally circumventing epistemics and transcending rationality.

Deck = SOUL

Field = MATRIX  
Zone = MATRIX POTENTIAL  
Play = EXECUTE  
Life Points = TIME  
Attack = INFLUENCE  
Defend = RESIST  
Discard = FORGET  
Tap = EXHAUST  
Untap = AWAKEN  
Target = IDENTIFY  
Discard Pile = HISTORY  
Removed From Game = VOID  
Destroy = DELETE

HAND = HAND

This game solves the main problems of INWO:

\-No barrier to entry, free digital (email me, PHYSICAL version for collectors)

\-Open to and requesting input from community, this is for The People  
\-greatly simplified rules, with even more concentrated knowledge  
\-up to date/real time memetic response  
\-Real memes/art/pictures  
\-BOTH backwards and forwards compatible!!! (1800-2100AD+)  
\-I consider this game to be ""revealed"" to me, as the nearly complete plans/rules/concept/theory/implications/instructions just showed up in my head and started to demand to come out. Make of that what you will. Some Terry Davis type jazz. If any Good comes of this, all credit to the Divine.

Card Types:

Anthropos - (""creatures+"")  
Resources - (""Mana""+)  
Memes - (""spells""+)  
Avatars - (""heroes"")  
Infrastructure ? (""defenders""+)

Resource Types:

Blackmail -  
Attention -  
Crypto -  
Metal -  
Cash - \[Worth 3x resources, does not ""untap"" during awaken phase\]  
Market -

Full Set Distribution: (all unique)

Anthropos: \~25 each resource color  
Memes: \~35 each resource color  
Avatars: 14 total.  
Infrastructure: \~10 each resource color  
Resources: \~ 7 of each color

\-Cards are the same size as in Magic the Gathering, 2.5x3.5in

\-All cards are equally rare.

Some have suggested that these may used in the same way tarot is. I'm not a degenerate pagan, but I can say that the card #s were about 90% randomly assigned, completed and digitally released on 12/31/2020-1/1/2021. When I posted this online I got consecutive dubs, dubs, double dubs, immediately locked out of the site with a never before seen false error message, hours later the physical cards were delivered 4!!! days early. I can attest that the synchronistic anomalies with this thing are stubbornly awesome, persistent, too long to list. This tool is a mustard seed, a most peculiar cultural artifact, it is a mechanism to use asymmetric memetic feedback loops to immunize the zeitgeist from synthetic epistemics or ""order out chaos"". It is a sword, a seed, a flower, an ark, and a rock.

**My Background**  
At home when I (34M) we mainly played 2 types of boardgames: roll and move (monoply, the goose game, ...) and knowledge based games (trivial pursuit, some dutch dictionanry game, ...). While I liked playing with my family board gaming was not my main favourite activity.  
Later in my life Catan came out and I was triggered a bit more, because (for me at the time) this game had theme. But when I played it the first time, I was about 11 years old, very unaware that board gaming was considered a hobby. So during the years I played mainly with my family the same games.  
Until about 4-5 years ago I bought “Legends of Andor”, this was the real eye opener for me a game that, after all the others, had so much theme in it. I played through all the scenarios in 3 days or so. After that I weant on searching for something that was less of a puzzle and more lets-kill-some-monsters type of game. For that I found Castle Ravenloft, but the real change was during this research finding out about BGG and a lot of Youtube channels about boardgames. All of which led me to the rabbit hole that is the hobby.  
My latest revelation in this is Facebook groups for secondhand games, which does not save me a lot of money but does increase the amount of games I can get for the same amount of cash.

**Player profile**  
My main playing partner is my wife. I like complex games with lots of theme in them and my wife likes more thinkier games with streamlined rulesets.

\- Space war

\- Economic euro

And now as I just purchased Spirit Island, inserts do not take into account sleeved cards (again) and I am thinking this will be another plastic waste that will sleep in some place in my home.

I love this sort of game, rpging is my first love, so whenever a game comes along like Tales of the Arabian Nights, the original Arkham Horror I was all over it, and to some extent still am.

It's something of a golden age for the rpging boardgamer, Above and Below, and these epics like 7th Continent and so forth are really scratching that itch.  I am almost spoiled for choice, time was I would have said I've played all that were available, but now, no way.

It's been a long journey.  Six years.  I discovered this passion in my second year of college, and now well graduated, my collection is stronger than ever.  
My friends started playing Catan in highschool.  Soon enough, I got it and hooked everyone.  Next was the Munchkin craze.  Everyone was blasting Munchkin at every gathering.  Once my Munchkin phase was over, that's when I got really invested into the board gaming scene.  Binging Rahdo, Watch it Played, and SUSD, all day, to research every new game and it's rules.  I love this hobby because I get to share it with everyone I know.  I see them discover my joy, and find their own.  We create our own culture, Meta, and vocabulary for our games.

**Favorite games:**    
Root, Cosmic Encounter, Kemet, Android: Netrunner, Gaia Project, Caverna    
    
**Proudest Game in Collection:**      
My entire, completed collection of the original Netrunner, by FFG    
    
**Players:**    
I have many game circles, all people I know personally.  My fiancé and I explore two players.  My cousins meet occasionally to discover more of my games, even with their toddlers disturbing us.  My college buddies are the most hardcore gamers.  We rarely get together, due to them still being in school, but I can drop a new heavy Euro, and they'll gobble it up in no time.    
**What would you change about your collection if you could?**    
I made a ton of bad buys, and games I never touched.  I eventually sold them.  I'd fall into the trap of new, hyped games, when a classic has already done the same.  I would focus more on heavier euros, and more elegant, complex games from the start.  I'd only need a few simple, well-rounded, classics for me to introduce new players.","[COMC] Big collection, 6 Years into the hobby and a new shelf"

Hey,

I've had my eyes on Catacombs as my first dexterity game for quite a while. Their Kickstarter launched a few days ago, and will end in 3 days already. Now, since I might as well buy the retail edition for about 60% of the price, could someone elaborate if the game (and the stretch goals) is/are worth it overall, and if the playmats are better than the retail boards? I heard that the edges don't really stick down, and that stickers (?) may leave uneven spots.

Also, is the enormous price gap between the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX"" pledge (130CA$) and the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX PLUS"" pledge (340 CA$) reflected in what you get out of the extra stuff in your opinion?

And on a side note, should I even bother to get Catacombs, or is Crokinole that much better?

Players can either play as red or blue (Red always starts first). Each player has 7(actually 6) different pieces at their disposal. The objective is to eliminate your opponent's chateau, which is the most valuable piece, in the sense that if they lose it they just lose the game. You can do this by either crushing it or throwing it off the board.

 Yes! You can throw pieces in this. The throwing mechanic is really simple but when you first hear it, you might get confused. So let me explain.

 When a piece that gets on a square that is already occupied by another piece, regardless of color, the original piece that was on the square will get thrown differently depending on which piece threw it. I will explain this better after I introduce the pieces.

Note: I made the board out of a strong cardboard and made every piece by some play dough which I hardened.

\---------The Pieces--------

Note: Pieces can be eliminated by getting thrown off the board or by getting crushed by a chateau.

Note: A player can intentionally walk off their pieces off the board.

(1x)Chateau:

\*When a game starts, the red chateau is placed at (5,5) and the blue chateau is placed at (6,6)

\*When a player's chateau is eliminated, it is game over for them.

\*Can not move by itself.

\*The chateau can spawn any piece that hasn't been eliminated or spawned before in a 5x5 square that it is in the center of. 

\*If thrown, the first piece the chateau bumps into both stops the chateau and directly eliminates the piece it bumped into. (This is an ability that only the chateau has)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Gladiator:

\*Can only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If it gets on a square that is already occupied, it throws the piece occypying it either 2 squares to the left or 2 squares to the right. (Lets say there is a gladiator on (3,3) and it moves to (4,3) where a chateau was standing. Now it throws to chateau to either (4,5) or (4,1))

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Bull:

\*It can see all the way to the north, south, east and west. Can normally only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a bull is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,1) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,1) which are (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,1). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Ram:

(Basically a diagonal bull)

\*It can see all the way to the northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. Can normally only move northeast, southeast, northeast and southwest one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a ram is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,5) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,5) which are (2,2), (3,3) and (4,4). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,8). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wall:

\*Can't do anything.

\*Seriously

\*Doesn't mean its useless tho

\*It can block like rams or bulls or soften a throw(I will tell you about that)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wizard:

\*Can see all the way to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can move only one square to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can pull the first piece it has vision on right next to itself (Lets say a wizard is on (2,2) , there is a wall on (5,5) and a ram on (2,8). The wizard can pull the wall to (3,3) or pull the ram to (2,3).)

\*Pushes pieces only one square.

\*Can be placable for both players only after a chateau regardless of color gets thrown.

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Giant(it is currently not legal, waiting for suggestions)

\*Can see and move to the north, south, west, east, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest only one square

\*Has unlimited throwing power, it will make every piece go flying.

Yeah I made this piece but never used it. It is currently banned because it is too overpowered. The purpose of the giant was to keep the action maximum in every position. It was originally only able to be spawned after a player's every single piece had been eliminated. But I noticed that getting rid of every piece is VERY hard even when you do it intentionally. The piece still exist with some scrapped ideas but I would like to see what other people think it may be good for.

&amp;#x200B;

\-But wait! Yeah pieces can throw each other but what happens if a piece bumps into another piece when it arrives at its destined square?

It just makes the other piece move 1 square the direction it bumped in

\-But what if bumps in to another piece while it is still on the way to its destined square?

It makes the piece it bumped move 1 square and it becomes the new occupier of the square 

&amp;#x200B;

Those principles apply to throwing.

But when you have 15 cards out on the table that you're dealing with, and you're trying to mitigate extra movement or actions using equipment cards and skills... Well, it just always gets so crazy that I completely forget about reloading. Every game I'd always  make sure I bought extra ammo for all my soldiers during the kit out phase, only to never end up using it because I'm so  focused on making that hit / kill roll that I'd forget to check for reload.

45,boardgames,"So, I’ve been doing YouTube how to play videos, solo playthroughs and things of that nature. 

I’m about to get into doing reviews as well, and I was curious, for anyone reading this what question gets answered for you in a board game review. 

Do you watch reviews for the entertainment aspect?

Maybe you’re watching to learn if a particular game has any mechanics that you might like. 

Or maybe you want to know if the reviewer your watching likes the game and would recommend it. 

I’m sure people watch reviews, how to plays and other board game content for a myriad of reasons, but I’m curious what are you hoping to learn from a review. 

Also, I’m curious as to what sort of format you like to see in reviews. Do you like reviews that are super structured, for example. 

“Today we are reviewing Everdell, and in this review I’m going to break it down for you by theme, art, quality, player interaction, gameplay, etc etc....”

Or do you prefer a more free flowing style where the reviewer literally just jumps from topic to topic in no real formal way, talking to the camera as if trying to sell a friend on how good or bad a game is. 

Also what do you feel about a letter or number score as opposed to “I recommend or do not recommend this game”

And lastly, do you like a more objective review or subjective. Ie, I could say objectively Lost Ruins of Arnak is a great game. The mechanics at play really mesh well together m, bla bla bla. But subjectively, I don’t like it because of A, B, and C. (I actually love Arnak, but just as an example)",Do you watch board game reviews and what question gets answered for you?

50,boardgames,"During the pandemic, my beloved hobby of playing board games with friends (at the table) has been, as I guess for many others in here, pretty much dead. I just re-arranged all my board games in a new shelf and got this idea; what if we could play board games over a conference call / video live with everyone participating from home. I have a lot of friends and colleagues that wants to play, but I’m the one with the games. Meaning we need to play with only one copy of the game. 

I’m really curious if anyone have tried this - in that case what game and how did it go?
If not, then do you have any ideas on what games that could work and how this could be done?

I’m thinking party games in general should be fine, some deduction games and maybe puzzle / mystery solving etc. Hidden roles can be done by showing a card to each player while all others close their eyes / camera. Some coop-games should work fine if all information is public. 

I’m thinking to set up a camera that films the table for everyone to see. Also it could be possible to use regular dice and playing cards as component replacements as I expect everyone to have this at disposal.

One thing that will not work is holding a hidden deck/cards/etc. for players. Open decks could be placed in «player areas» on the table and be shown on camera, so this should work fine.

Note: Please dont recommend apps, PC-games etc. as alternatives. I know and use these, but I want to try this concept with the «real deal»!

Out of my collection I’m thinking these could maybe work:
• Camel Up
• Castles of Burgundy
• Chronicles of Crime
• Codenames (each clue-giver takes a screenshot of the answer card)
• Ghost Stories
• Hey, That’s my Fish
• Magic Maze (this is probably too hard to coordinate)
• Mysterium
• One Night Ultimate Werewolf (maybe without some roles / game master)
• Pandemic
• Ricochet Robots
• Scotland Yard
• Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective
• Small World
• Telestrations
• When I Dream

HONKTOPIA: Illuminati New World Order: Open Source Community Edition: A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

Premier fully functional + meta balanced hyper-compressible meta-memeplex psycho-cultural-alchemic-memetic technology that uses neurolinguistics, hyper-juxtaposition, and  other methods to circumvent synthetic epistemics while programming the players into a 4g/5g warfare psycho-spiritual frame. It exploits memetic virality and asymmetric  psychological-archetypal memetic feedback loops. It takes the form of a trading card game, but it is so, so much more. This is the full 501 card set, and comes with a custom box artwork file (pictured). This is the first of its kind to offer meritocratic access to the zeitgeist. It is a memetic snapshot of 2020. A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

CULTURE WINS WARS. STR33T 4LCH3MY.

Illuminati New World Order set out to expose via card gamification, the World Gamification. The resistance towards and stickiness of the idea means these projects are over the target. The other 4chan and INWO projects always seem to fail, for whatever reason. So I decided to take it upon myself, so there would be no excuse not to complete it. I designed this game as a psycho-cultural-spiritual-memetic weapon-seed-ark. The idea is to train people into an effective perspective, while bringing their memeplex up to date, all abstracted under lulz. I offer this so that you might have content to freely offer someone else and engage with them. The idea is to have the gateway be ""like forbidden lulz??"", and then break the programming implicitly through hyper juxtaposition and archetypal drift. It's content, at minimum. Print them if you want.

This is an open source community project. I want it to run off crypto to combat revisionism and to pay the anons who contribute powerful memes, automatically. This is a method to construct culture meritocratically and transparently, on any scale. Think of the cards as ""culture units"", and their addition to the game as an ""operating body"", upon which the wider ""real"" games that are downstream of culture units are based on. We have reached a phase of development where the 'salt of the earth' makes the best culture(memes), because we are the ones who shoulder shoulder suffering. You'd need military grade training and still often make less viral memes then organic ones (without artificial power-structure support). Essentially, think of this of a movie (culture), of which The People pick the constituent archetypes, scene by scene, in realtime. It's everything a government is sans the bureaucracy, logistics, and corruption. This is a truly unique and interesting cultural artifact.

The information war is a rigged game. We lose by consenting/playing the rigged game, we win by setting the game. Were not in an information war, it's closer to a knowledge war, which may might seem even more daunting, but creativity can be a big player here (vs battling big tech), and if we start playing the knowledge game while they're still playing information game, they won't be able to compete, because their entire empire is based on manipulating information, and if they were to try and train their slaves in knowledge warfare, they would end up setting them free.

The information war was lost before it began, due to asymmetric metaphysical limitations. The information war is a farce. Below that is a mystery/gnostic/luciferian power structure based on the manipulation of knowledge. Both the knowledge game and the information game are asymmetric, but in opposite directions, this is why they want people to think this is an information war because it's the only one they can win.

 Plays like a mixture between yugioh, INWO, and Magic. Most similar to Magic, except ""memes"" have a board locality (""virulence"") mechanic which indicates how far the ""effect"" of the Meme jumps to adjacent connected targets. Infrastructure is like a ""defender"" creature in Magic, except that it also has health. Infrastructure of corresponding resource color is required to play 7+ resource cost Anthropos (creatures), indicated by the golden dragon around their rightmost cost (alternatively you must ""offer/sacrifice"" an Anthropos from the Matrix). Avatars determine your ""Time"" (life points) for the game, the unique win condition, and your special ability for the entire game. This way, 2 decks with the same cards but different Avatars can employ completely different strategies and have different objectives. Memes are essentially spells. Board position is important. Can be quickly and intuitively learned with prior Magic and or Yugioh experience. Built to be intuitive, totally circumventing epistemics and transcending rationality.

Deck = SOUL

Field = MATRIX  
Zone = MATRIX POTENTIAL  
Play = EXECUTE  
Life Points = TIME  
Attack = INFLUENCE  
Defend = RESIST  
Discard = FORGET  
Tap = EXHAUST  
Untap = AWAKEN  
Target = IDENTIFY  
Discard Pile = HISTORY  
Removed From Game = VOID  
Destroy = DELETE

HAND = HAND

This game solves the main problems of INWO:

\-No barrier to entry, free digital (email me, PHYSICAL version for collectors)

\-Open to and requesting input from community, this is for The People  
\-greatly simplified rules, with even more concentrated knowledge  
\-up to date/real time memetic response  
\-Real memes/art/pictures  
\-BOTH backwards and forwards compatible!!! (1800-2100AD+)  
\-I consider this game to be ""revealed"" to me, as the nearly complete plans/rules/concept/theory/implications/instructions just showed up in my head and started to demand to come out. Make of that what you will. Some Terry Davis type jazz. If any Good comes of this, all credit to the Divine.

Card Types:

Anthropos - (""creatures+"")  
Resources - (""Mana""+)  
Memes - (""spells""+)  
Avatars - (""heroes"")  
Infrastructure ? (""defenders""+)

Resource Types:

Blackmail -  
Attention -  
Crypto -  
Metal -  
Cash - \[Worth 3x resources, does not ""untap"" during awaken phase\]  
Market -

Full Set Distribution: (all unique)

Anthropos: \~25 each resource color  
Memes: \~35 each resource color  
Avatars: 14 total.  
Infrastructure: \~10 each resource color  
Resources: \~ 7 of each color

\-Cards are the same size as in Magic the Gathering, 2.5x3.5in

\-All cards are equally rare.

Some have suggested that these may used in the same way tarot is. I'm not a degenerate pagan, but I can say that the card #s were about 90% randomly assigned, completed and digitally released on 12/31/2020-1/1/2021. When I posted this online I got consecutive dubs, dubs, double dubs, immediately locked out of the site with a never before seen false error message, hours later the physical cards were delivered 4!!! days early. I can attest that the synchronistic anomalies with this thing are stubbornly awesome, persistent, too long to list. This tool is a mustard seed, a most peculiar cultural artifact, it is a mechanism to use asymmetric memetic feedback loops to immunize the zeitgeist from synthetic epistemics or ""order out chaos"". It is a sword, a seed, a flower, an ark, and a rock.

**My Background**  
At home when I (34M) we mainly played 2 types of boardgames: roll and move (monoply, the goose game, ...) and knowledge based games (trivial pursuit, some dutch dictionanry game, ...). While I liked playing with my family board gaming was not my main favourite activity.  
Later in my life Catan came out and I was triggered a bit more, because (for me at the time) this game had theme. But when I played it the first time, I was about 11 years old, very unaware that board gaming was considered a hobby. So during the years I played mainly with my family the same games.  
Until about 4-5 years ago I bought “Legends of Andor”, this was the real eye opener for me a game that, after all the others, had so much theme in it. I played through all the scenarios in 3 days or so. After that I weant on searching for something that was less of a puzzle and more lets-kill-some-monsters type of game. For that I found Castle Ravenloft, but the real change was during this research finding out about BGG and a lot of Youtube channels about boardgames. All of which led me to the rabbit hole that is the hobby.  
My latest revelation in this is Facebook groups for secondhand games, which does not save me a lot of money but does increase the amount of games I can get for the same amount of cash.

**Player profile**  
My main playing partner is my wife. I like complex games with lots of theme in them and my wife likes more thinkier games with streamlined rulesets.

\- Space war

\- Economic euro

And by this, I usually chuck away the inserts, chuck away meaning I slid them in some part of the house as I can NEVER EVER throw them away (for some reason) though useless they are. 

And now as I just purchased Spirit Island, inserts do not take into account sleeved cards (again) and I am thinking this will be another plastic waste that will sleep in some place in my home. I just realized that I want to start throwing inserts to the bin and not keep them. Just do not know how to get my mind into it and how to start.

It's something of a golden age for the rpging boardgamer, Above and Below, and these epics like 7th Continent and so forth are really scratching that itch.  I am almost spoiled for choice, time was I would have said I've played all that were available, but now, no way. I probably won't have time enough in my life to play all such things now, and barely the ones on my shelf! And that's great!

But back to City of Chaos - I really enjoyed it, and tried to get it to the table a lot.  My friends were perhaps not as tolerant as some of its failings as I was, so probably I couldn't play it as much as I liked, but they all said they enjoyed it to some degree.  What about you? Have you ever played, or ever wanted to?

Have you even heard of it? It is from a while ago...

I am hoping that they can make it a little easier to get money, but they keep the elements of engaging humour. It was a pretty bleak world, and the laugh amongst the gravestones was very heartening.","With the City of Chaos set to return to shelves soon, what are your thoughts?"

DM screens for D&amp;D jump to mind, of course. But the first ones I found were $20+ apiece, and this game goes up to six players. We're not looking to drop $120 into fixing this issue, nevermind how thematically mismatched those would be.",Better Player Screens for Custom Heroes?

It's been a long journey.  Six years.  I discovered this passion in my second year of college, and now well graduated, my collection is stronger than ever.  
My friends started playing Catan in highschool.  Soon enough, I got it and hooked everyone.  Next was the Munchkin craze.  Everyone was blasting Munchkin at every gathering.  Once my Munchkin phase was over, that's when I got really invested into the board gaming scene.  Binging Rahdo, Watch it Played, and SUSD, all day, to research every new game and it's rules.  I love this hobby because I get to share it with everyone I know.  I see them discover my joy, and find their own.  We create our own culture, Meta, and vocabulary for our games.

**Favorite games:**    
Root, Cosmic Encounter, Kemet, Android: Netrunner, Gaia Project, Caverna    
    
**Proudest Game in Collection:**      
My entire, completed collection of the original Netrunner, by FFG    
    
**Players:**    
I have many game circles, all people I know personally.  My fiancé and I explore two players.  My cousins meet occasionally to discover more of my games, even with their toddlers disturbing us.  My college buddies are the most hardcore gamers.  We rarely get together, due to them still being in school, but I can drop a new heavy Euro, and they'll gobble it up in no time.    
**What would you change about your collection if you could?**    
I made a ton of bad buys, and games I never touched.  I eventually sold them.  I'd fall into the trap of new, hyped games, when a classic has already done the same.  I would focus more on heavier euros, and more elegant, complex games from the start.  I'd only need a few simple, well-rounded, classics for me to introduce new players.","[COMC] Big collection, 6 Years into the hobby and a new shelf"

We have gotten together twice and played two Hunt a Killer seasons and five Deadbolt Mystery Society Boxes. (We dont want to subscribe to anything so we've been getting past seasons or one time boxes.) We also played an Exit the last time we got together and really liked it. We have done 2 Exit games over zoom and found that it works really well for us when we can't get together. (We live several hours apart). 

We are planning a get together in May and I've been looking into other boxed set companies and the Unlock games.

Now I looked in the rules and there doesn't seem to be anything in there regarding this. The rules say the player should pull 6 cubes in a 2 player game. But do they just stop if they pull the 2 red cubes then put them back in? Or is there some other option where they refresh the bag and pull 6 red cubes?

Hey,

I've had my eyes on Catacombs as my first dexterity game for quite a while. Their Kickstarter launched a few days ago, and will end in 3 days already. Now, since I might as well buy the retail edition for about 60% of the price, could someone elaborate if the game (and the stretch goals) is/are worth it overall, and if the playmats are better than the retail boards? I heard that the edges don't really stick down, and that stickers (?) may leave uneven spots.

Also, is the enormous price gap between the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX"" pledge (130CA$) and the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX PLUS"" pledge (340 CA$) reflected in what you get out of the extra stuff in your opinion?

And on a side note, should I even bother to get Catacombs, or is Crokinole that much better?

34,boardgames,"A few months ago, I really started to get into chess. I really liked the idea of a miniature battlefield with tons of tactics and openings while still keeping it simple. So I decided that it would be fun to make one. In its current state it is playable but I bet there is room for development.

Note: Explaining this on text is hard. The game is actually really simple but all the cordinate stuff may  make it look confusing.

I call it ""Emerald Game"" or just ""Emerald"". It is a two player game played on a square 10 by 10 board which is roughly 900cm²(When writing coordinates, the x axis comes first. Eg: (x,y).). Players can either play as red or blue (Red always starts first). Each player has 7(actually 6) different pieces at their disposal. The objective is to eliminate your opponent's chateau, which is the most valuable piece, in the sense that if they lose it they just lose the game. You can do this by either crushing it or throwing it off the board.

 Yes! You can throw pieces in this. The throwing mechanic is really simple but when you first hear it, you might get confused. So let me explain.

 When a piece that gets on a square that is already occupied by another piece, regardless of color, the original piece that was on the square will get thrown differently depending on which piece threw it. I will explain this better after I introduce the pieces.

Note: I made the board out of a strong cardboard and made every piece by some play dough which I hardened.

\---------The Pieces--------

Note: Pieces can be eliminated by getting thrown off the board or by getting crushed by a chateau.

Note: A player can intentionally walk off their pieces off the board.

(1x)Chateau:

\*When a game starts, the red chateau is placed at (5,5) and the blue chateau is placed at (6,6)

\*When a player's chateau is eliminated, it is game over for them.

\*Can not move by itself.

\*The chateau can spawn any piece that hasn't been eliminated or spawned before in a 5x5 square that it is in the center of. 

\*If thrown, the first piece the chateau bumps into both stops the chateau and directly eliminates the piece it bumped into. (This is an ability that only the chateau has)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Gladiator:

\*Can only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If it gets on a square that is already occupied, it throws the piece occypying it either 2 squares to the left or 2 squares to the right. (Lets say there is a gladiator on (3,3) and it moves to (4,3) where a chateau was standing. Now it throws to chateau to either (4,5) or (4,1))

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Bull:

\*It can see all the way to the north, south, east and west. Can normally only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a bull is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,1) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,1) which are (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,1). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Ram:

(Basically a diagonal bull)

\*It can see all the way to the northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. Can normally only move northeast, southeast, northeast and southwest one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a ram is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,5) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,5) which are (2,2), (3,3) and (4,4). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,8). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wall:

\*Can't do anything.

\*Seriously

\*Doesn't mean its useless tho

\*It can block like rams or bulls or soften a throw(I will tell you about that)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wizard:

\*Can see all the way to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can move only one square to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can pull the first piece it has vision on right next to itself (Lets say a wizard is on (2,2) , there is a wall on (5,5) and a ram on (2,8). The wizard can pull the wall to (3,3) or pull the ram to (2,3).)

\*Pushes pieces only one square.

\*Can be placable for both players only after a chateau regardless of color gets thrown.

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Giant(it is currently not legal, waiting for suggestions)

\*Can see and move to the north, south, west, east, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest only one square

\*Has unlimited throwing power, it will make every piece go flying.

Yeah I made this piece but never used it. It is currently banned because it is too overpowered. The purpose of the giant was to keep the action maximum in every position. It was originally only able to be spawned after a player's every single piece had been eliminated. But I noticed that getting rid of every piece is VERY hard even when you do it intentionally. The piece still exist with some scrapped ideas but I would like to see what other people think it may be good for.

&amp;#x200B;

\-But wait! Yeah pieces can throw each other but what happens if a piece bumps into another piece when it arrives at its destined square?

It just makes the other piece move 1 square the direction it bumped in

\-But what if bumps in to another piece while it is still on the way to its destined square?

It makes the piece it bumped move 1 square and it becomes the new occupier of the square 

&amp;#x200B;

Those principles apply to throwing.

39,boardgames,"I mean, I've tried. Lots of times. But when you have 15 cards out on the table that you're dealing with, and you're trying to mitigate extra movement or actions using equipment cards and skills... Well, it just always gets so crazy that I completely forget about reloading. Every game I'd always  make sure I bought extra ammo for all my soldiers during the kit out phase, only to never end up using it because I'm so  focused on making that hit / kill roll that I'd forget to check for reload. Eventually I just stopped putting the chits out. I feel a little guilt about it but, if nothing else, that means fewer things to knock over while I'm playing

43,boardgames,"So, I’ve been doing YouTube how to play videos, solo playthroughs and things of that nature. 

I’m about to get into doing reviews as well, and I was curious, for anyone reading this what question gets answered for you in a board game review. 

Do you watch reviews for the entertainment aspect?

Maybe you’re watching to learn if a particular game has any mechanics that you might like. 

Or maybe you want to know if the reviewer your watching likes the game and would recommend it. 

I’m sure people watch reviews, how to plays and other board game content for a myriad of reasons, but I’m curious what are you hoping to learn from a review. 

Also, I’m curious as to what sort of format you like to see in reviews. Do you like reviews that are super structured, for example. 

“Today we are reviewing Everdell, and in this review I’m going to break it down for you by theme, art, quality, player interaction, gameplay, etc etc....”

Or do you prefer a more free flowing style where the reviewer literally just jumps from topic to topic in no real formal way, talking to the camera as if trying to sell a friend on how good or bad a game is. 

Also what do you feel about a letter or number score as opposed to “I recommend or do not recommend this game”

And lastly, do you like a more objective review or subjective. Ie, I could say objectively Lost Ruins of Arnak is a great game. The mechanics at play really mesh well together m, bla bla bla. But subjectively, I don’t like it because of A, B, and C. (I actually love Arnak, but just as an example)",Do you watch board game reviews and what question gets answered for you?

48,boardgames,"During the pandemic, my beloved hobby of playing board games with friends (at the table) has been, as I guess for many others in here, pretty much dead. I just re-arranged all my board games in a new shelf and got this idea; what if we could play board games over a conference call / video live with everyone participating from home. I have a lot of friends and colleagues that wants to play, but I’m the one with the games. Meaning we need to play with only one copy of the game. 

I’m really curious if anyone have tried this - in that case what game and how did it go?
If not, then do you have any ideas on what games that could work and how this could be done?

I’m thinking party games in general should be fine, some deduction games and maybe puzzle / mystery solving etc. Hidden roles can be done by showing a card to each player while all others close their eyes / camera. Some coop-games should work fine if all information is public. 

I’m thinking to set up a camera that films the table for everyone to see. Also it could be possible to use regular dice and playing cards as component replacements as I expect everyone to have this at disposal.

One thing that will not work is holding a hidden deck/cards/etc. for players. Open decks could be placed in «player areas» on the table and be shown on camera, so this should work fine.

Note: Please dont recommend apps, PC-games etc. as alternatives. I know and use these, but I want to try this concept with the «real deal»!

Out of my collection I’m thinking these could maybe work:
• Camel Up
• Castles of Burgundy
• Chronicles of Crime
• Codenames (each clue-giver takes a screenshot of the answer card)
• Ghost Stories
• Hey, That’s my Fish
• Magic Maze (this is probably too hard to coordinate)
• Mysterium
• One Night Ultimate Werewolf (maybe without some roles / game master)
• Pandemic
• Ricochet Robots
• Scotland Yard
• Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective
• Small World
• Telestrations
• When I Dream

HONKTOPIA: Illuminati New World Order: Open Source Community Edition: A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

Premier fully functional + meta balanced hyper-compressible meta-memeplex psycho-cultural-alchemic-memetic technology that uses neurolinguistics, hyper-juxtaposition, and  other methods to circumvent synthetic epistemics while programming the players into a 4g/5g warfare psycho-spiritual frame. It exploits memetic virality and asymmetric  psychological-archetypal memetic feedback loops. It takes the form of a trading card game, but it is so, so much more. This is the full 501 card set, and comes with a custom box artwork file (pictured). This is the first of its kind to offer meritocratic access to the zeitgeist. It is a memetic snapshot of 2020. A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

CULTURE WINS WARS. STR33T 4LCH3MY.

Illuminati New World Order set out to expose via card gamification, the World Gamification. The resistance towards and stickiness of the idea means these projects are over the target. The other 4chan and INWO projects always seem to fail, for whatever reason. So I decided to take it upon myself, so there would be no excuse not to complete it. I designed this game as a psycho-cultural-spiritual-memetic weapon-seed-ark. The idea is to train people into an effective perspective, while bringing their memeplex up to date, all abstracted under lulz. I offer this so that you might have content to freely offer someone else and engage with them. The idea is to have the gateway be ""like forbidden lulz??"", and then break the programming implicitly through hyper juxtaposition and archetypal drift. It's content, at minimum. Print them if you want.

This is an open source community project. I want it to run off crypto to combat revisionism and to pay the anons who contribute powerful memes, automatically. This is a method to construct culture meritocratically and transparently, on any scale. Think of the cards as ""culture units"", and their addition to the game as an ""operating body"", upon which the wider ""real"" games that are downstream of culture units are based on. We have reached a phase of development where the 'salt of the earth' makes the best culture(memes), because we are the ones who shoulder shoulder suffering. You'd need military grade training and still often make less viral memes then organic ones (without artificial power-structure support). Essentially, think of this of a movie (culture), of which The People pick the constituent archetypes, scene by scene, in realtime. It's everything a government is sans the bureaucracy, logistics, and corruption. This is a truly unique and interesting cultural artifact.

The information war is a rigged game. We lose by consenting/playing the rigged game, we win by setting the game. Were not in an information war, it's closer to a knowledge war, which may might seem even more daunting, but creativity can be a big player here (vs battling big tech), and if we start playing the knowledge game while they're still playing information game, they won't be able to compete, because their entire empire is based on manipulating information, and if they were to try and train their slaves in knowledge warfare, they would end up setting them free.

The information war was lost before it began, due to asymmetric metaphysical limitations. The information war is a farce. Below that is a mystery/gnostic/luciferian power structure based on the manipulation of knowledge. Both the knowledge game and the information game are asymmetric, but in opposite directions, this is why they want people to think this is an information war because it's the only one they can win.

 Plays like a mixture between yugioh, INWO, and Magic. Most similar to Magic, except ""memes"" have a board locality (""virulence"") mechanic which indicates how far the ""effect"" of the Meme jumps to adjacent connected targets. Infrastructure is like a ""defender"" creature in Magic, except that it also has health. Infrastructure of corresponding resource color is required to play 7+ resource cost Anthropos (creatures), indicated by the golden dragon around their rightmost cost (alternatively you must ""offer/sacrifice"" an Anthropos from the Matrix). Avatars determine your ""Time"" (life points) for the game, the unique win condition, and your special ability for the entire game. This way, 2 decks with the same cards but different Avatars can employ completely different strategies and have different objectives. Memes are essentially spells. Board position is important. Can be quickly and intuitively learned with prior Magic and or Yugioh experience. Built to be intuitive, totally circumventing epistemics and transcending rationality.

Deck = SOUL

Field = MATRIX  
Zone = MATRIX POTENTIAL  
Play = EXECUTE  
Life Points = TIME  
Attack = INFLUENCE  
Defend = RESIST  
Discard = FORGET  
Tap = EXHAUST  
Untap = AWAKEN  
Target = IDENTIFY  
Discard Pile = HISTORY  
Removed From Game = VOID  
Destroy = DELETE

HAND = HAND

This game solves the main problems of INWO:

\-No barrier to entry, free digital (email me, PHYSICAL version for collectors)

\-Open to and requesting input from community, this is for The People  
\-greatly simplified rules, with even more concentrated knowledge  
\-up to date/real time memetic response  
\-Real memes/art/pictures  
\-BOTH backwards and forwards compatible!!! (1800-2100AD+)  
\-I consider this game to be ""revealed"" to me, as the nearly complete plans/rules/concept/theory/implications/instructions just showed up in my head and started to demand to come out. Make of that what you will. Some Terry Davis type jazz. If any Good comes of this, all credit to the Divine.

Card Types:

Anthropos - (""creatures+"")  
Resources - (""Mana""+)  
Memes - (""spells""+)  
Avatars - (""heroes"")  
Infrastructure ? (""defenders""+)

Resource Types:

Blackmail -  
Attention -  
Crypto -  
Metal -  
Cash - \[Worth 3x resources, does not ""untap"" during awaken phase\]  
Market -

Full Set Distribution: (all unique)

Anthropos: \~25 each resource color  
Memes: \~35 each resource color  
Avatars: 14 total.  
Infrastructure: \~10 each resource color  
Resources: \~ 7 of each color

\-Cards are the same size as in Magic the Gathering, 2.5x3.5in

\-All cards are equally rare.

Some have suggested that these may used in the same way tarot is. I'm not a degenerate pagan, but I can say that the card #s were about 90% randomly assigned, completed and digitally released on 12/31/2020-1/1/2021. When I posted this online I got consecutive dubs, dubs, double dubs, immediately locked out of the site with a never before seen false error message, hours later the physical cards were delivered 4!!! days early. I can attest that the synchronistic anomalies with this thing are stubbornly awesome, persistent, too long to list. This tool is a mustard seed, a most peculiar cultural artifact, it is a mechanism to use asymmetric memetic feedback loops to immunize the zeitgeist from synthetic epistemics or ""order out chaos"". It is a sword, a seed, a flower, an ark, and a rock.

**My Background**  
At home when I (34M) we mainly played 2 types of boardgames: roll and move (monoply, the goose game, ...) and knowledge based games (trivial pursuit, some dutch dictionanry game, ...). While I liked playing with my family board gaming was not my main favourite activity.  
Later in my life Catan came out and I was triggered a bit more, because (for me at the time) this game had theme. But when I played it the first time, I was about 11 years old, very unaware that board gaming was considered a hobby. So during the years I played mainly with my family the same games.  
Until about 4-5 years ago I bought “Legends of Andor”, this was the real eye opener for me a game that, after all the others, had so much theme in it. I played through all the scenarios in 3 days or so. After that I weant on searching for something that was less of a puzzle and more lets-kill-some-monsters type of game. For that I found Castle Ravenloft, but the real change was during this research finding out about BGG and a lot of Youtube channels about boardgames. All of which led me to the rabbit hole that is the hobby.  
My latest revelation in this is Facebook groups for secondhand games, which does not save me a lot of money but does increase the amount of games I can get for the same amount of cash.

**Player profile**  
My main playing partner is my wife. I like complex games with lots of theme in them and my wife likes more thinkier games with streamlined rulesets.

**Favorite games in collection**  
Mansions of madness (2e), Above and below, Teotihuacan, Raiders of the North Sea; Trickerion

**Newest games in my collection**  
Second hand: Comanauts, Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn, Robinson Crusoe: Andventures on a cursed island

Genre is a very loose term here, where it could mean a particular theme (space, fantasy, etc.) or mechanism or a combination of them and more. For example:

\- Space war

\- Economic euro

\- Heavy Uwe Rosenburg game

And by this, I usually chuck away the inserts, chuck away meaning I slid them in some part of the house as I can NEVER EVER throw them away (for some reason) though useless they are. 

And now as I just purchased Spirit Island, inserts do not take into account sleeved cards (again) and I am thinking this will be another plastic waste that will sleep in some place in my home. I just realized that I want to start throwing inserts to the bin and not keep them. Just do not know how to get my mind into it and how to start.

I love this sort of game, rpging is my first love, so whenever a game comes along like Tales of the Arabian Nights, the original Arkham Horror I was all over it, and to some extent still am.

It's something of a golden age for the rpging boardgamer, Above and Below, and these epics like 7th Continent and so forth are really scratching that itch.  I am almost spoiled for choice, time was I would have said I've played all that were available, but now, no way.

My game is aspired from the game Tarkov (A brutal video game) so I wanted to make a game which has the same brutal feel to it so I could play it with my friends, there is 8 player spawns, each player has to collect items from the ground and sell it to the traders therefore you can buy a winning item. If you buy 5 items and return them safely to your base you win the game. if you die you drop your stuff in the same place you died in. also there is 4 equipment tiers. you also have quests you could take from the trades (I have not completed that one). 

I made this game irl but it turned out to be hard and I don't have the time to do it  currently so I thought if I published it there might some people would enjoy it. if you have any questions just ask And I would be more than happy to answer. this is the map the cards etc...

It's been a long journey.  Six years.  I discovered this passion in my second year of college, and now well graduated, my collection is stronger than ever.  
My friends started playing Catan in highschool.  Soon enough, I got it and hooked everyone.  Next was the Munchkin craze.  Everyone was blasting Munchkin at every gathering.  Once my Munchkin phase was over, that's when I got really invested into the board gaming scene.  Binging Rahdo, Watch it Played, and SUSD, all day, to research every new game and it's rules.  I love this hobby because I get to share it with everyone I know.  I see them discover my joy, and find their own.  We create our own culture, Meta, and vocabulary for our games.

**Favorite games:**    
Root, Cosmic Encounter, Kemet, Android: Netrunner, Gaia Project, Caverna    
    
**Proudest Game in Collection:**      
My entire, completed collection of the original Netrunner, by FFG    
    
**Players:**    
I have many game circles, all people I know personally.  My fiancé and I explore two players.  My cousins meet occasionally to discover more of my games, even with their toddlers disturbing us.  My college buddies are the most hardcore gamers.  We rarely get together, due to them still being in school, but I can drop a new heavy Euro, and they'll gobble it up in no time.    
**What would you change about your collection if you could?**    
I made a ton of bad buys, and games I never touched.  I eventually sold them.  I'd fall into the trap of new, hyped games, when a classic has already done the same.  I would focus more on heavier euros, and more elegant, complex games from the start.  I'd only need a few simple, well-rounded, classics for me to introduce new players.","[COMC] Big collection, 6 Years into the hobby and a new shelf"
2,boardgames,"My best friend Jay and I have really gotten into escape room games at home during this pandemic. We have gotten together twice and played two Hunt a Killer seasons and five Deadbolt Mystery Society Boxes. (We dont want to subscribe to anything so we've been getting past seasons or one time boxes.) We also played an Exit the last time we got together and really liked it. We have done 2 Exit games over zoom and found that it works really well for us when we can't get together. (We live several hours apart). 

We are planning a get together in May and I've been looking into other boxed set companies and the Unlock games. 

Anyone with experience with escape room games at home either with murder mystery boxed sets like Hunt a Killer or Exit games have any other recommendations for things we could play together?

I'm looking into:
Unlock
The Conundrum Box
Escape the Crate
Sleuth Kings 

But am very open to any and all other suggestions.

We are quickly working through the Exit series over zoom as we want to play at least every other week. (We each buy our own box and since Exit is cheap it has been pretty affordable) I'm also wondering if Unlock will work as well via zoom. Or what other games would work well via zoom.

Now I looked in the rules and there doesn't seem to be anything in there regarding this. The rules say the player should pull 6 cubes in a 2 player game. But do they just stop if they pull the 2 red cubes then put them back in? Or is there some other option where they refresh the bag and pull 6 red cubes?

Hey,

I've had my eyes on Catacombs as my first dexterity game for quite a while. Their Kickstarter launched a few days ago, and will end in 3 days already. Now, since I might as well buy the retail edition for about 60% of the price, could someone elaborate if the game (and the stretch goals) is/are worth it overall, and if the playmats are better than the retail boards? I heard that the edges don't really stick down, and that stickers (?) may leave uneven spots.

Also, is the enormous price gap between the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX"" pledge (130CA$) and the ""Catacombs 3E BIG BOX PLUS"" pledge (340 CA$) reflected in what you get out of the extra stuff in your opinion?

And on a side note, should I even bother to get Catacombs, or is Crokinole that much better?

34,boardgames,"A few months ago, I really started to get into chess. I really liked the idea of a miniature battlefield with tons of tactics and openings while still keeping it simple. So I decided that it would be fun to make one. In its current state it is playable but I bet there is room for development.

Note: Explaining this on text is hard. The game is actually really simple but all the cordinate stuff may  make it look confusing.

I call it ""Emerald Game"" or just ""Emerald"". It is a two player game played on a square 10 by 10 board which is roughly 900cm²(When writing coordinates, the x axis comes first. Eg: (x,y).). Players can either play as red or blue (Red always starts first). Each player has 7(actually 6) different pieces at their disposal. The objective is to eliminate your opponent's chateau, which is the most valuable piece, in the sense that if they lose it they just lose the game. You can do this by either crushing it or throwing it off the board.

 Yes! You can throw pieces in this. The throwing mechanic is really simple but when you first hear it, you might get confused. So let me explain.

 When a piece that gets on a square that is already occupied by another piece, regardless of color, the original piece that was on the square will get thrown differently depending on which piece threw it. I will explain this better after I introduce the pieces.

Note: I made the board out of a strong cardboard and made every piece by some play dough which I hardened.

\---------The Pieces--------

Note: Pieces can be eliminated by getting thrown off the board or by getting crushed by a chateau.

Note: A player can intentionally walk off their pieces off the board.

(1x)Chateau:

\*When a game starts, the red chateau is placed at (5,5) and the blue chateau is placed at (6,6)

\*When a player's chateau is eliminated, it is game over for them.

\*Can not move by itself.

\*The chateau can spawn any piece that hasn't been eliminated or spawned before in a 5x5 square that it is in the center of. 

\*If thrown, the first piece the chateau bumps into both stops the chateau and directly eliminates the piece it bumped into. (This is an ability that only the chateau has)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Gladiator:

\*Can only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If it gets on a square that is already occupied, it throws the piece occypying it either 2 squares to the left or 2 squares to the right. (Lets say there is a gladiator on (3,3) and it moves to (4,3) where a chateau was standing. Now it throws to chateau to either (4,5) or (4,1))

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Bull:

\*It can see all the way to the north, south, east and west. Can normally only move north, south, east and west one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a bull is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,1) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,1) which are (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,1). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(2x)Ram:

(Basically a diagonal bull)

\*It can see all the way to the northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. Can normally only move northeast, southeast, northeast and southwest one square.

\*If there is a piece in its vision, it can move all the way to the square it stands on and throw it. It can't stop midway.

\*The amount it pushes a piece is calculated by how many squares there were BETWEEN it and its target. (Lets say that a ram is standing on (1,1) and it wants to throw a gladiator on (5,5) there are 3 squares between (1,1) and (5,5) which are (2,2), (3,3) and (4,4). So now the gladiator will get thrown to (8,8). So this means that it can't move to squares which it could normally move if a piece stood there since there wouldn't be any squares between them.)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wall:

\*Can't do anything.

\*Seriously

\*Doesn't mean its useless tho

\*It can block like rams or bulls or soften a throw(I will tell you about that)

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Wizard:

\*Can see all the way to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can move only one square to north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest.

\*Can pull the first piece it has vision on right next to itself (Lets say a wizard is on (2,2) , there is a wall on (5,5) and a ram on (2,8). The wizard can pull the wall to (3,3) or pull the ram to (2,3).)

\*Pushes pieces only one square.

\*Can be placable for both players only after a chateau regardless of color gets thrown.

&amp;#x200B;

(1x)Giant(it is currently not legal, waiting for suggestions)

\*Can see and move to the north, south, west, east, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest only one square

\*Has unlimited throwing power, it will make every piece go flying.

Yeah I made this piece but never used it. It is currently banned because it is too overpowered. The purpose of the giant was to keep the action maximum in every position. It was originally only able to be spawned after a player's every single piece had been eliminated. But I noticed that getting rid of every piece is VERY hard even when you do it intentionally. The piece still exist with some scrapped ideas but I would like to see what other people think it may be good for.

&amp;#x200B;

\-But wait! Yeah pieces can throw each other but what happens if a piece bumps into another piece when it arrives at its destined square?

It just makes the other piece move 1 square the direction it bumped in

\-But what if bumps in to another piece while it is still on the way to its destined square?

It makes the piece it bumped move 1 square and it becomes the new occupier of the square 

&amp;#x200B;

Those principles apply to throwing.

43,boardgames,"So, I’ve been doing YouTube how to play videos, solo playthroughs and things of that nature. 

I’m about to get into doing reviews as well, and I was curious, for anyone reading this what question gets answered for you in a board game review. 

Do you watch reviews for the entertainment aspect?

Maybe you’re watching to learn if a particular game has any mechanics that you might like. 

Or maybe you want to know if the reviewer your watching likes the game and would recommend it. 

I’m sure people watch reviews, how to plays and other board game content for a myriad of reasons, but I’m curious what are you hoping to learn from a review. 

Also, I’m curious as to what sort of format you like to see in reviews. Do you like reviews that are super structured, for example. 

“Today we are reviewing Everdell, and in this review I’m going to break it down for you by theme, art, quality, player interaction, gameplay, etc etc....”

Or do you prefer a more free flowing style where the reviewer literally just jumps from topic to topic in no real formal way, talking to the camera as if trying to sell a friend on how good or bad a game is. 

Also what do you feel about a letter or number score as opposed to “I recommend or do not recommend this game”

And lastly, do you like a more objective review or subjective. Ie, I could say objectively Lost Ruins of Arnak is a great game. The mechanics at play really mesh well together m, bla bla bla. But subjectively, I don’t like it because of A, B, and C. (I actually love Arnak, but just as an example)",Do you watch board game reviews and what question gets answered for you?

48,boardgames,"During the pandemic, my beloved hobby of playing board games with friends (at the table) has been, as I guess for many others in here, pretty much dead. I just re-arranged all my board games in a new shelf and got this idea; what if we could play board games over a conference call / video live with everyone participating from home. I have a lot of friends and colleagues that wants to play, but I’m the one with the games. Meaning we need to play with only one copy of the game. 

I’m really curious if anyone have tried this - in that case what game and how did it go?
If not, then do you have any ideas on what games that could work and how this could be done?

I’m thinking party games in general should be fine, some deduction games and maybe puzzle / mystery solving etc. Hidden roles can be done by showing a card to each player while all others close their eyes / camera. Some coop-games should work fine if all information is public. 

I’m thinking to set up a camera that films the table for everyone to see. Also it could be possible to use regular dice and playing cards as component replacements as I expect everyone to have this at disposal.

One thing that will not work is holding a hidden deck/cards/etc. for players. Open decks could be placed in «player areas» on the table and be shown on camera, so this should work fine.

Note: Please dont recommend apps, PC-games etc. as alternatives. I know and use these, but I want to try this concept with the «real deal»!

Out of my collection I’m thinking these could maybe work:
• Camel Up
• Castles of Burgundy
• Chronicles of Crime
• Codenames (each clue-giver takes a screenshot of the answer card)
• Ghost Stories
• Hey, That’s my Fish
• Magic Maze (this is probably too hard to coordinate)
• Mysterium
• One Night Ultimate Werewolf (maybe without some roles / game master)
• Pandemic
• Ricochet Robots
• Scotland Yard
• Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective
• Small World
• Telestrations
• When I Dream

HONKTOPIA: Illuminati New World Order: Open Source Community Edition: A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

Premier fully functional + meta balanced hyper-compressible meta-memeplex psycho-cultural-alchemic-memetic technology that uses neurolinguistics, hyper-juxtaposition, and  other methods to circumvent synthetic epistemics while programming the players into a 4g/5g warfare psycho-spiritual frame. It exploits memetic virality and asymmetric  psychological-archetypal memetic feedback loops. It takes the form of a trading card game, but it is so, so much more. This is the full 501 card set, and comes with a custom box artwork file (pictured). This is the first of its kind to offer meritocratic access to the zeitgeist. It is a memetic snapshot of 2020. A TRUE memetic philosopher's stone.

CULTURE WINS WARS. STR33T 4LCH3MY.

Illuminati New World Order set out to expose via card gamification, the World Gamification. The resistance towards and stickiness of the idea means these projects are over the target. The other 4chan and INWO projects always seem to fail, for whatever reason. So I decided to take it upon myself, so there would be no excuse not to complete it. I designed this game as a psycho-cultural-spiritual-memetic weapon-seed-ark. The idea is to train people into an effective perspective, while bringing their memeplex up to date, all abstracted under lulz. I offer this so that you might have content to freely offer someone else and engage with them. The idea is to have the gateway be ""like forbidden lulz??"", and then break the programming implicitly through hyper juxtaposition and archetypal drift. It's content, at minimum. Print them if you want.

This is an open source community project. I want it to run off crypto to combat revisionism and to pay the anons who contribute powerful memes, automatically. This is a method to construct culture meritocratically and transparently, on any scale. Think of the cards as ""culture units"", and their addition to the game as an ""operating body"", upon which the wider ""real"" games that are downstream of culture units are based on. We have reached a phase of development where the 'salt of the earth' makes the best culture(memes), because we are the ones who shoulder shoulder suffering. You'd need military grade training and still often make less viral memes then organic ones (without artificial power-structure support). Essentially, think of this of a movie (culture), of which The People pick the constituent archetypes, scene by scene, in realtime. It's everything a government is sans the bureaucracy, logistics, and corruption. This is a truly unique and interesting cultural artifact.

The information war is a rigged game. We lose by consenting/playing the rigged game, we win by setting the game. Were not in an information war, it's closer to a knowledge war, which may might seem even more daunting, but creativity can be a big player here (vs battling big tech), and if we start playing the knowledge game while they're still playing information game, they won't be able to compete, because their entire empire is based on manipulating information, and if they were to try and train their slaves in knowledge warfare, they would end up setting them free.

The information war was lost before it began, due to asymmetric metaphysical limitations. The information war is a farce. Below that is a mystery/gnostic/luciferian power structure based on the manipulation of knowledge. Both the knowledge game and the information game are asymmetric, but in opposite directions, this is why they want people to think this is an information war because it's the only one they can win.

 Plays like a mixture between yugioh, INWO, and Magic. Most similar to Magic, except ""memes"" have a board locality (""virulence"") mechanic which indicates how far the ""effect"" of the Meme jumps to adjacent connected targets. Infrastructure is like a ""defender"" creature in Magic, except that it also has health. Infrastructure of corresponding resource color is required to play 7+ resource cost Anthropos (creatures), indicated by the golden dragon around their rightmost cost (alternatively you must ""offer/sacrifice"" an Anthropos from the Matrix). Avatars determine your ""Time"" (life points) for the game, the unique win condition, and your special ability for the entire game. This way, 2 decks with the same cards but different Avatars can employ completely different strategies and have different objectives. Memes are essentially spells. Board position is important. Can be quickly and intuitively learned with prior Magic and or Yugioh experience. Built to be intuitive, totally circumventing epistemics and transcending rationality.

Deck = SOUL

Field = MATRIX  
Zone = MATRIX POTENTIAL  
Play = EXECUTE  
Life Points = TIME  
Attack = INFLUENCE  
Defend = RESIST  
Discard = FORGET  
Tap = EXHAUST  
Untap = AWAKEN  
Target = IDENTIFY  
Discard Pile = HISTORY  
Removed From Game = VOID  
Destroy = DELETE

HAND = HAND

This game solves the main problems of INWO:

\-No barrier to entry, free digital (email me, PHYSICAL version for collectors)

\-Open to and requesting input from community, this is for The People  
\-greatly simplified rules, with even more concentrated knowledge  
\-up to date/real time memetic response  
\-Real memes/art/pictures  
\-BOTH backwards and forwards compatible!!! (1800-2100AD+)  
\-I consider this game to be ""revealed"" to me, as the nearly complete plans/rules/concept/theory/implications/instructions just showed up in my head and started to demand to come out. Make of that what you will. Some Terry Davis type jazz. If any Good comes of this, all credit to the Divine.

Card Types:

Anthropos - (""creatures+"")  
Resources - (""Mana""+)  
Memes - (""spells""+)  
Avatars - (""heroes"")  
Infrastructure ? (""defenders""+)

Resource Types:

Blackmail -  
Attention -  
Crypto -  
Metal -  
Cash - \[Worth 3x resources, does not ""untap"" during awaken phase\]  
Market -

Full Set Distribution: (all unique)

Anthropos: \~25 each resource color  
Memes: \~35 each resource color  
Avatars: 14 total.  
Infrastructure: \~10 each resource color  
Resources: \~ 7 of each color

\-Cards are the same size as in Magic the Gathering, 2.5x3.5in

\-All cards are equally rare.

Some have suggested that these may used in the same way tarot is. I'm not a degenerate pagan, but I can say that the card #s were about 90% randomly assigned, completed and digitally released on 12/31/2020-1/1/2021. When I posted this online I got consecutive dubs, dubs, double dubs, immediately locked out of the site with a never before seen false error message, hours later the physical cards were delivered 4!!! days early. I can attest that the synchronistic anomalies with this thing are stubbornly awesome, persistent, too long to list. This tool is a mustard seed, a most peculiar cultural artifact, it is a mechanism to use asymmetric memetic feedback loops to immunize the zeitgeist from synthetic epistemics or ""order out chaos"". It is a sword, a seed, a flower, an ark, and a rock.

**My Background**  
At home when I (34M) we mainly played 2 types of boardgames: roll and move (monoply, the goose game, ...) and knowledge based games (trivial pursuit, some dutch dictionanry game, ...). While I liked playing with my family board gaming was not my main favourite activity.  
Later in my life Catan came out and I was triggered a bit more, because (for me at the time) this game had theme. But when I played it the first time, I was about 11 years old, very unaware that board gaming was considered a hobby. So during the years I played mainly with my family the same games.  
Until about 4-5 years ago I bought “Legends of Andor”, this was the real eye opener for me a game that, after all the others, had so much theme in it. I played through all the scenarios in 3 days or so. After that I weant on searching for something that was less of a puzzle and more lets-kill-some-monsters type of game. For that I found Castle Ravenloft, but the real change was during this research finding out about BGG and a lot of Youtube channels about boardgames. All of which led me to the rabbit hole that is the hobby.  
My latest revelation in this is Facebook groups for secondhand games, which does not save me a lot of money but does increase the amount of games I can get for the same amount of cash.

**Player profile**  
My main playing partner is my wife. I like complex games with lots of theme in them and my wife likes more thinkier games with streamlined rulesets.

**Favorite games in collection**  
Mansions of madness (2e), Above and below, Teotihuacan, Raiders of the North Sea; Trickerion

**Newest games in my collection**  
Second hand: Comanauts, Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn, Robinson Crusoe: Andventures on a cursed island

Genre is a very loose term here, where it could mean a particular theme (space, fantasy, etc.) or mechanism or a combination of them and more. For example:

\- Hidden movement

\- Space war

\- Economic euro

\- Heavy Uwe Rosenburg game

And by this, I usually chuck away the inserts, chuck away meaning I slid them in some part of the house as I can NEVER EVER throw them away (for some reason) though useless they are. 

And now as I just purchased Spirit Island, inserts do not take into account sleeved cards (again) and I am thinking this will be another plastic waste that will sleep in some place in my home. I just realized that I want to start throwing inserts to the bin and not keep them. Just do not know how to get my mind into it and how to start. Probably as I feel attached to my stuff, as growing up, we cannot afford the things I want then, and only now as I grew older that I managed to buy things for myself.","Manufacturer Inserts - Rant, What To Do, and Whatever It Is"

It's something of a golden age for the rpging boardgamer, Above and Below, and these epics like 7th Continent and so forth are really scratching that itch.  I am almost spoiled for choice, time was I would have said I've played all that were available, but now, no way.

It'd be cool to see you and other people watching or even participating in a live event, 1 thing i specifically imagined was a racing event on a neon map as an event or maybe even gamemode...I think this would be so cool but let me know what you think in the comments!",Rocket League Live Events (idea)

However, after seeing some of the wild shit people do as you get up higher than that, it's become obvious that my stubbornness about how ball cam frustrates me is something I'm going to need to get over to move past my current progression.

&amp;#x200B;

  However, it feels so off, everything about it.  Like your car goes in almost a circle around the ball, but I can never tell where my car is actually going to go when I push a direction.  It almost feels like something is counterintuitive about it. So idk, I was hoping for some general advice that might make learning and using ball cam easier to get the hang of.

  However, it feels so off, everything about it.  Like your car goes in almost a circle around the ball, but I can never tell where my car is actually going to go when I push a direction.  It almost feels like something is counterintuitive about it. So idk, I was hoping for some general advice that might make learning and using ball cam easier to get the hang of.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Topping out at high plat/low diamond without ball cam,  I find it awkward and need advice on how to use it effectively.","Any advice on how to better understand the general ""movement"" of your car while in ball cam? (serious)"

I wanted to ask, for those of you who use this binding, do you keep your right index finger on the gas and then switch to the boost when needed, or do you keep your right index finger on the boost and right middle finger on the gas so that you can easily switch from one to the other?

Another way is flying around and driving, Think of yourself in a game or more of an area with 50 or more people flying, boosting, and driving around at a concert or live event, say maybe like a dj playing while we watch in are car while running around and flying all over the place, or maybe even a drive out of a volcano or anything like that.

63,RocketLeague,"Hey, guys!

I've watched the twitch rlcs streams this weekend and claimed all the 3 drops.
In the first I didn't get lucky and got a banner.
The second drop was claimed yesterday, but it wasn't delivered in the game even after several logins in the game.
The third one was claimed today, and immediately after, I logged in and was awarded with two items.
The first one was a tw dominus rlcs x decal and the second one was another banner.
What hapenned is that both banners were kept on my inventory and the decal literaly disappeared. 
Did anything happened like this to anyone before?

78,RocketLeague,"So, after this season, I've found that I can hang with tier 1 diamond without using ball cam a lot.  However, after seeing some of the wild shit people do as you get up higher than that, it's become obvious that my stubbornness about how ball cam frustrates me is something I'm going to need to get over to move past my current progression.

&amp;#x200B;

  However, it feels so off, everything about it.  Like your car goes in almost a circle around the ball, but I can never tell where my car is actually going to go when I push a direction.  It almost feels like something is counterintuitive about it. So idk, I was hoping for some general advice that might make learning and using ball cam easier to get the hang of.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Topping out at high plat/low diamond without ball cam,  I find it awkward and need advice on how to use it effectively.","Any advice on how to better understand the general ""movement"" of your car while in ball cam? (serious)"

88,RocketLeague,"So me and my friend wanted to warm up in some casual doubles. We end up getting matched with ""FreeZ Veez"" and ""Tazihr"". They immediately start just playing for freestyles. Me and my friend get kinda pissed and look Freez Veez up on RLTracker. Turns out that he's SSL/GC 3 and is either not ranked in Casual or is smurfing somehow. Either way it's really annoying and I can't even enjoy myself when these guys are just constantly passing back and missing freestyles.",Casual is so broken
89,RocketLeague,"And it'll happen again in another 1,000 games. Casual games. Because in ranked this would have been an embarrassing whiff.","I read, I boosted, I scored."
90,RocketLeague,"So I recently just changed my boost binding (PS4) from circle to R1 (that would be from B to LB on Xbox). I wanted to ask, for those of you who use this binding, do you keep your right index finger on the gas and then switch to the boost when needed, or do you keep your right index finger on the boost and right middle finger on the gas so that you can easily switch from one to the other? I don't really find that all comfortable, but with me using square/circle (or X/B on xbox) for air roll I'm not really sure I have any other choice. What do you guys think?",Acceleration/Boost bindings
91,RocketLeague,"I was 1540 in 3s. Now I’m champ 2 div 2. I was champ 3 d4 in 2s..now I’m champ 2 d4 in that. Season is about to end soon and I’m 6/10 for my GC rewards. I’ve no joke been losing every overtime. I’m not even playing bad I’m just straight up losing. Crazy thing is I’ve been getting faster too but just can’t win. Shit makes me not even want to get on anymore. I wish I go travel back in time to when I was gc 1 I took that shit for granted. 

Haha I literally don’t think I have the willpower to fight thru champ 3 again and get 4 wins in GC before season is over..if I actually don’t get my gc rewards and I’m still stuck wearing a Season 14 GC title in season 3..idek what ima do. Prolly cry on some real shit

I get scored on so much when I’m not in goal and I’ve been getting blown up 4+ times every game it seems like🥴jus needed to rant lol how are u guys doing in RL right now ?",Fell from GC-1 to c2 and my ass is not getting back up😂
